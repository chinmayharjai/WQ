## Source: file://20250415_190154_how-brain-platform-works.html

The below post illustrates in detail how the BRAIN platform works and what happens in the background when you simulate an Alpha.
Even though youll never need to do these calculations yourselves, developing an intuition for them will help you in the Alpha making process.

Imagine market data being a matrix, with each row representing one date and each column representing one stock.
For example, the matrix for close price data of stocks in universe US TOP3000 would look like this

When you input the simulation settings and click Simulate, the BRAIN platform will evaluate the Alpha expression against the matrix of market data for each date in a five year span, taking a long or short position for each financial instrument to generate the PnL chart.

Behind the scenes, seven steps, or operations, are performed before the final PnL chart is generated.

Normally, in an Alpha simulation, there would be between 200 and 3,000 stock instruments in the universe.
But to better understand this concept, well assume a hypothetical scenario in which the simulation universe has only eight stocks.
We simulate the expression rank-returns with market neutralization, Delay 1 and Decay 0 settings for now.

The hypothesis in this expression is that we want to buy, or go long on, those stocks tomorrow that had negative or comparatively lower returns today, and we want to sell, or go short on, those stocks tomorrow that had positive or comparatively higher returns today.

Weve used the rank operator, which ranks the input values inside the operator and return values equally distributed between zero and 1.
This is an example of a reversion idea.

In Column B, we have the eight stocks in the Alpha vector.
Column C shows the returns of these stocks as of February 1st.
These serve as the input data of the Alpha expression.

Step1 Evaluate the expression for each stock to generate the Alpha vector for the given date.

In our case, this date would be February 2nd, because weve assumed Delay 1 settings.
The Delay 1 setting uses data as of T-1 date to create the Alpha vector as of T date.

To produce the Alpha vector, the simulator performs the rank operation on negative returns and produces a vector of values corresponding to each stock.

The resulting vector depends on the operators used in the Alpha expression.
In our case, since weve used the rank operator, we see equally distributed values between 0 and 1 in Column D.
Note that the stock with the lowest return has the highest value, and vice versa, in line with our hypothesis.

Step 2 From each value in the vector, subtract the average of the vector values in the group.
Sum of all vector values  0.
This is called neutralization.

The group can be the entire market, but we can also perform this neutralization operation on sector, industry or subindustry groupings of stocks.

Since we have only eight stocks in our simulation universe, weve assumed to neutralize the stocks over the market.

So we take the average of the numbers in Cell D12 and subtract the average from each stock.
This gives us a new vector in Column F.
Note that both the sum and the average of these new numbers are now zero.
Also, the sum of positive values is equal to the sum of negative values.

Step 3 The resulting values are scaled or normalized such that absolute sum of the Alpha vector values is 1.
These values can be called as normalized weights.

That means, we sum the absolute values of each row and find the sum, which is 2.3.
Then we divide each row by this sum, which results in normalized values.
By normalize, we mean that the total absolute sum of Column H is 1.
We can also call this vector a normalized vector of weights.

Note On each iterationday, the expression rank-returns will have access to all the data for returns up to that day, and the matrix will grow by one line every day until it reaches the most recent date.
The role of the expression is to transform the input matrix to an output vector of weights as we see in this hypothetical example.

Step 4 Using normalized weights, the BRAIN simulator allocates capital from a fictitious book of 20 million to each stock to construct a portfolio.

Column J has a total of 20 million of fictional money allocated to the stocks, using the normalized weights in Column H.
This means we have a position of minus 4.4 million in Stock 1  that is, weve shorted 4.4 million worth of Stock 1  and a long position of 0.6 million in Stock 5.
That is, weve invested 0.6 million in Stock 5.

This is called long-short market neutralization, and its the backbone of creating these predictive models, or Alphas, on BRAIN.
With this technique, a strategy can have the potential to be profitable regardless of the direction of the market.

Step 5 Calculate next day PnL generated by the Alpha based on observed stock returns the next day

That is, after allocating dollar positions on the stocks, we calculate the PnL generated by each stock, based on the returns each stock had that day.

Suppose the actual returns on these stocks as of February 2nd are as shown in Column K.
We see that although we expected Stock 1 and Stock 2 to fall in price, they actually went up, so we had a loss, shown in Column L.

We expected Stock 6 to go up in price, but it stayed flat.
So we were wrong about three stocks, but we were right about five.
In total, we made a gain of 0.03 million on this day with our Alpha, calculated by adding the PnLs of all stocks in our vector.
This is how the simulator calculates the PnL generated by the Alpha for any given date.

Step 6 Perform the operations in Step 1 to Step 5 for each date in a several-year history span also called the In-sample period IS to get daily PnL generated for each day

For each day, the expression is evaluated and the values in the Alpha output vector represent the weights to allocate to each stock.
Alpha weights are not how much you want to buy or sell, but a weighting position you would reach this day.
These weights are multiplied by book size total money invested in the portfolio to get the dollar value held in each stock.
For example, if the Alpha weight after neutralization and scaling for MSFT is 0.2423, then well have MSFT stocks with the total value 0.2423book size.

The weight can be negative, meaning you would take a short position on these stocks.
If the value is positive, you would take a long position on these stocks, i.e.
buy the stocks.
A NAN value would mean no weight is allocated to that instrument i.e.
no money is allocated.
The value of stocks you buysell on a particular day is determined by the difference between weights today and weights yesterday.
The percentage of your portfolio traded in a day by dollar value is called turnover.
The turnover reported in simulation results is the average daily turnover over the simulation.

Step 7 Calculate the cumulative PnL of the Alpha from the start of the in-sample period to get the PnL chart of the Alpha.

Based on those daily positions, PnL is calculated and displayed.
By default, the BRAIN platform will normalize your weights according to the operations you enter and create a portfolio of 20 million total booksize worth of equity.
Note that a portfolio is just a collection of securities.

This can be better understood with the help of the PnL chart of the Alpha in our example rank-returns

In this chart, we have an IS period of five years, from February 2016 to January 2021.
Using the steps from the example, the simulator would calculate the daily PnL of the Alpha and derive the cumulative PnL chart, as we see here.
Note that the two years from February 2021 to January 2023 are not visible to us in the simulation window.
Thats called the out-of-sample, or the OS, period.
After you submit an Alpha, several tests are run to analyze the Alphas performance in the OS period.
An Alpha that passes both the in-sample and out-of-sample tests can be said to be a robust Alpha.

This is how the BRAIN simulator creates the PnL chart from an Alpha.

In our example, weve assumed that were using market neutralization and Decay 0 settings.
But if we used any other neutralization settings, the same operations would be performed on the Alpha.

Say we have 80 stocks in our simulation universe  ten industries with eight stocks each.
The simulator would perform the same operations first Step 1 to Step 5 on each of the ten groups and finally add the PnL from each group to get the daily PnL of the Alpha and create the cumulative PnL chart Step 6 and Step 7

However, if we introduce decay into our Alpha settings, an additional step must be performed to get the final Alpha vector.

Suppose we use a decay of 3 in our simulation settings.
The final vector of weights in the Alpha would be calculated by combining todays value with the previous days decayed value.
In our example, we calculated the normalized weights in the Alpha as of February 2nd.
Lets assume that the normalized weights of stocks in the Alpha vector on February 1st and January 31st are as shown in Columns N and O, respectively.

Then the final weights in the Alpha would be calculated using the given weighted average formula

which is implemented in Column P.
Using this new derived vector, the simulator would calculate the daily PnL and consequently the cumulative PnL chart.
Note that even if decay is used, more weight is assigned to the most recent values.
So decay is an important factor in reducing transaction costs or turnover, as it includes information from previous days, preventing the Alpha from being reactive.

To summarize, once we input the Alpha expression and simulation settings in the BRAIN simulator, it performs the operations discussed above to take long or short positions for each financial instrument and generates the PnL chart.

The below post illustrates in detail how the BRAIN platform works and what happens in the background when you simulate an Alpha.
Even though youll never need to do these calculations yourselves, developing an intuition for them will help you in the Alpha making process.

Note that the stock with the lowest return has the highest value, and vice versa, in line with our hypothesis.

Step 2 From each value in the vector, subtract the average of the vector values in the group.
Sum of all vector values  0.
This is called neutralization.

The group can be the entire market, but we can also perform this neutralization operation on sector, industry or subindustry groupings of stocks.

Since we have only eight stocks in our simulation universe, weve assumed to neutralize the stocks over the market.

So we take the average of the numbers in Cell D12 and subtract the average from each stock.
This gives us a new vector in Column F.
Note that both the sum and the average of these new numbers are now zero.
Also, the sum of positive values is equal to the sum of negative values.

Step 3 The resulting values are scaled or normalized such that absolute sum of the Alpha vector values is 1.
These values can be called as normalized weights.

The weight can be negative, meaning you would take a short position on these stocks.

The percentage of your portfolio traded in a day by dollar value is called turnover.
The turnover reported in simulation results is the average daily turnover over the simulation.

## Table of Contents

In the Simulation result page, you will find a ratings panel in the Stats tab of Results that says Spectacular, Excellent, Good, Average or Needs Improvement depending on your Alphas Fitness as shown below

Return is the gain or loss of a security or portfolio in a particular period.
Return consists of the income received plus capital gains, relative to the amount of the investment.
In BRAIN, return  annualized PnL  half of book size.

Information ratio IR measures the prediction ability of a model.
In BRAIN, it is defined as the ratio of a portfolios mean daily returns to the volatility of those returns

where PnL is the daily profit and loss, in dollars.

Sharpe is the annualized version of the IR statistic, i.e.
Sharpe  sqrt 252IR  15.8IR where 252 is the average number of trading days days the markets are open in the USA in a year.

Sharpe or IR measures the returns of an Alpha while attempting to identify its consistency.
The higher the IR, the more consistent the Alphas returns are, and consistency is an ideal trait.
High Sharpe or IR is more desirable than just high return.

Note Sharpe and IR may be defined somewhat differently elsewhere than in BRAIN.

Fitness of an Alpha is a function of Returns, Turnover and Sharpe

Good Alphas have high fitness.
You can optimize the performance of your Alphas by increasing Sharpe or returns and reducing turnover.
Improving one factor normally has an adverse impact on the other factor.
As you work on optimizing your Alpha, an improvement in its fitness is an indication that your changes are having a positive impact.

Clicking the Sharpe Ratio in dropdown menu at the upper right from PnL graph displays the Sharpe ratio graph Sharpe over time.
Make sure that the PnL graph has an upward trend, the Sharpe is high and the Drawdown is kept to a minimum.

IS Summary Scrolling down to the Stats block shown below of the simulation results shows various metrics about the Alphas performance.

Returns The return on capital traded Annual Return  Annualized PnL  Half of Book Size.
It signifies the amount you made or lost during the period observed and is expressed in .
Book size refers to the amount of capital money used to trade during the simulation.
Book size is constant and is set to 20 million every day throughout the simulation.
Profit is not reinvested, and losses are replaced by cash injection into the portfolio.
BRAIN assumes you have 10 million and will invest in assets up to 20 million.
This is called leverage.
Performance like Returns, Sharpe is computed on a base of 10 million.

Turnover Turnover signifies how often one trades.
It can be defined as the ratio of value traded to book size.
Daily Turnover  Dollar trading volumeBook size.
Good Alphas have low turnover, since low turnover means lower transaction costs.

Margin The profit per dollar traded calculated as PnL divided by total dollars traded for a given time period.

PnL Profit and Loss PnL is the money that the positions and trades generate which means it is the amount of money you lost or made during the year, expressed in dollars.

daily_PnL  sum of size of position  daily_return for all instruments, where the daily return per instrument  todays close  yesterdays close  1.0.

Drawdown - the largest reduction in PnL during a time period, expressed as a percentage.
It is calculated as follows find the largest peak to trough drawdown in PnL, and divide its dollar amount by half of book size 1

Generate Self Correlation Clicking the Down Arrow button in a Self Correlation row will produce a table with the performance statistics of up to the 5 most correlated Alphas you submitted that qualified for OS testing.
This information is meant to help the user ensure they have a diverse set of Alphas.
This information can also be accessed by clicking on the Alpha in the Alphas page.

The rolling 5-year In-Sample simulation period begins seven years ago and ends two years ago, updating daily.
Using simulation settings, you can divide your In-Sample IS period into a Train and Test period.
The Train period can be utilized to develop your Alphas and SuperAlphas, while the Test period is ideal for validating them.
An Alpha developed based on the simulation results of training period and performs well in both periods is likely a strong candidate for submission and may have avoided overfitting.

The latest two years of data, the Semi-OS, are hidden for scoring and testing purposes.
Consultants have access to a 10-year In-sample period, instead of 5-year.

Keeping the last 2 years of data hidden leads to higher confidence in the Out-Sample OS performance of Alphas and their scores.
Statistics shown in the OS Tab of My Alphas page will be populated as data becomes available by each passing day.

## Table of Contents

BRAIN is a web-based tool for backtesting trading ideas.
An Alpha is a concrete trading idea that can be simulated historically.

In BRAIN, an Alpha refers to a mathematical model, written as an expression, which places different bets weights on different instruments stocks, and is expected to be profitable in the long run.
After a user enters an Alpha expression that consists of data, operators and constants, the input code is evaluated for each instrument to construct a portfolio.
Then BRAIN makes investments in each instrument for a one-day period in proportion to the values of the expression.
The process repeats each day.

The flow chart below shows the lifecycle of an Alpha

First, one might peruse blogs, journals and research papers on the internet to come up with an idea.
The Alpha expression is entered in BRAIN and operations like truncation,neutralization, decay are performed on the raw Alpha.
BRAIN makes investments goes long or short for all the instrumentsof the universe chosen in the Settings panel and the PnL is simulated.
Then the performance is calculated Sharpe, Turnover, Returns as seen in the Simulation Results page.
And if the Alpha is not deemed worthy, the Alpha idea is revised.
Else, it enters production.

In simple terms, BRAIN uses an Alpha to create a vector of weights, with each weight corresponding to one of the stocks in the selected universe.
These weights may or may not be market neutralized, as per your neutralization setting by market, industry, sub-industry or none.
This creates a portfolio for each day in the simulation period, which can then be used to calculate that days Profit and Loss PnL.

Suppose in the Expression box, you type in 1close, and set the simulation settings as follows Region  US, Universe  TOP3000, Delay  1, Decay  0, Neutralization  None, Truncation  0.
Now, once you hit Simulate button, then for each day in the Simulation Duration 5 years, the simulator does the followingIt calculates 1close using the closing price for the previous day, for each instrument in the basket US TOP3000 i.e.
top 3000 stocks in the US, by market capitalization.
This creates a vector of 3000 values one for each stock.
This vector is then normalized, i.e.
divided by the sum of its valuesso that all the values sum up to 1.
This creates a vector of weights for all the stocks, which is called a Portfolio.
Each weight represents the fraction of money invested in that stock.
If our booksize is 20 Million, then the money invested in each stock is 20M x weight of that stock in the portfolio.
This is done for each day in the simulation period, and at the end of each day the total profit or loss made by our portfolio is calculated.

BRAIN assigns positive weights to indicate long positions in stocks, and negative weights to indicate short positions in stocks.
The greater the magnitude of the weight on a stock, the larger the long or short position taken on it.

It is easy to invest 100 in stock, but negative positions shorts are common too.
E.g.
one can get 100 now by shorting a stock i.e.
investing -100, which must be bought back later.
PnL would be the opposite of 100 invested, as seen in the table below.
Negative weights are called short positions and positive weights are called long positions.
Typically investors take short positions when they expect stock price to decrease and long positions i.e.
buying stocks when they expect price to increase.
Please refer to Investopedia for more details on short selling.

The below table gives an example of payoffs from a 100 short and a 100 long position, for a 1 price change in each direction.
For simplicity, it does not account for dividends, margin and financing costs.

BRAIN is a web-based simulator of global financial markets that was created to explore Alpha research.
It accepts an Alpha expression as input and plots its Profit and Loss PnL as output.
The input expression is evaluated for each financial instrument, every day over historical dates, and a portfolio is constructed accordingly.
BRAIN invests in each financial instrument according to the value of the expression.
It takes positions either buying or short selling and assigns weights to each instrument.
The weights are then scaled to book size amount of money invested, based on which a PnL graph is plotted.
These weights are not constant they change over time based on current information and the history of the changes of some variables such as prices, volumes, etc..

BRAIN is a web-based tool for backtesting trading ideas.
An Alpha is a concrete trading idea that can be simulated historically.

In BRAIN, an Alpha refers to a mathematical model, written as an expression, which places different bets weights on different instruments stocks, and is expected to be profitable in the long run.
After a user enters an Alpha expression that consists of data, operators and constants, the input code is evaluated for each instrument to construct a portfolio.
Then BRAIN makes investments in each instrument for a one-day period in proportion to the values of the expression.
The process repeats each day.

The flow chart below shows the lifecycle of an Alpha

First, one might peruse blogs, journals and research papers on the internet to come up with an idea.
The Alpha expression is entered in BRAIN and operations like truncation,neutralization, decay are performed on the raw Alpha.
BRAIN makes investments goes long or short for all the instrumentsof the universe chosen in the Settings panel and the PnL is simulated.
Then the performance is calculated Sharpe, Turnover, Returns as seen in the Simulation Results page.
And if the Alpha is not deemed worthy, the Alpha idea is revised.
Else, it enters production.

In simple terms, BRAIN uses an Alpha to create a vector of weights, with each weight corresponding to one of the stocks in the selected universe.
These weights may or may not be market neutralized, as per your neutralization setting by market, industry, sub-industry or none.
This creates a portfolio for each day in the simulation period, which can then be used to calculate that days Profit and Loss PnL.

Suppose in the Expression box, you type in 1close, and set the simulation settings as follows Region  US, Universe  TOP3000, Delay  1, Decay  0, Neutralization  None, Truncation  0.
Now, once you hit Simulate button, then for each day in the Simulation Duration 5 years, the simulator does the followingIt calculates 1close using the closing price for the previous day, for each instrument in the basket US TOP3000 i.e.
top 3000 stocks in the US, by market capitalization.
This creates a vector of 3000 values one for each stock.
This vector is then normalized, i.e.
divided by the sum of its valuesso that all the values sum up to 1.
This creates a vector of weights for all the stocks, which is called a Portfolio.
Each weight represents the fraction of money invested in that stock.
If our booksize is 20 Million, then the money invested in each stock is 20M x weight of that stock in the portfolio.
This is done for each day in the simulation period, and at the end of each day the total profit or loss made by our portfolio is calculated.

BRAIN assigns positive weights to indicate long positions in stocks, and negative weights to indicate short positions in stocks.
The greater the magnitude of the weight on a stock, the larger the long or short position taken on it.

It is easy to invest 100 in stock, but negative positions shorts are common too.
E.g.
one can get 100 now by shorting a stock i.e.
investing -100, which must be bought back later.
PnL would be the opposite of 100 invested, as seen in the table below.
Negative weights are called short positions and positive weights are called long positions.
Typically investors take short positions when they expect stock price to decrease and long positions i.e.
buying stocks when they expect price to increase.

The Test Period is a feature designed to enhance your Alpha and SuperAlpha testing process.
This tool allows you to set a separate test period from your IS period, providing a more flexible approach to testing your research ideas.

Using the Feature

The Test Period feature is designed to help you avoid overfitting.
It allows you to divide your In-Sample IS period into a Train and Test period.
The Train period can be utilized to develop your Alphas and SuperAlphas, while the Test period is ideal for validating them.
An Alpha or SuperAlpha that is developed based on the simulation results of Training Period and performs well in both periods is likely a strong candidate for submission and may have avoided overfitting.

While choosing a Test period does not directly affect the simulation, it influences the statistics and the visualization.
The submission tests will run on the entire 5-year period, with the simulation running on the entire 5-year IS.
However, if a testing period is chosen, the simulation stats will be divided into two sections one covering the training period and another for the test period.

Navigating the Feature

###### Simulation Settings


###### Simulation Settings


###### Simulation Settings

The settings panel can be found by clicking the Settings button at the top right hand corner of the Simulate page.
You can specify parameters like language, instrument type, universe, delay, neutralization, etc., which will be applied to your next simulation after clicking the Apply button.

Fast Expression is available on BRAIN.
To learn more, refer to Available Operators

Only Equity instrument type can be used at the moment

The only region currently available to all BRAIN users is the US market.
The regions Europe and Asia are currently available only to our research consultants.

Universe is a set of trading instruments prepared by BRAIN.
For example, US TOP3000 represents the top 3000 most liquid stocks in the US market determined by highest average daily dollar volume traded.

Delay refers to the availability of data, relative to decision time.
In other words, delay is the assumption of when we can trade stock once we decide on a position.

Assume that you are looking at the data today before market close and you decide that you want to buy stock.
We can choose an aggressive approach and trade stock in the time left till market close.
In this case, the position is based on data available on the same day today.
This is called Delay 0 simulation.

Alternatively, we could choose a conservative trading strategy and trade stock the next daytomorrow.
Then the position is achieved tomorrow and it is based on todays data.
In this case, there is a lag of 1 day.
This is called Delay 1 simulation.
In expression language, delay is applied automatically and you do not have to bother about it.

This performs a linear decay function over the past n days by combining todays value with previous days decayed value.
It performs the following function

Legal values for Decay Integer n where n  0.
NOTE Using negative or non-integer values for Decay will break simulations.

Tip Decay can be used to reduce turnover, but decay values that are too large will attenuate the signal.

The maximum weight for each stock in the overall portfolio.
When it is set to 0, there is no restriction.

Legal values for Truncation Float x where 0  x  1 NOTE Any values for Truncation outside this range can impactbreak simulations.

Tip Truncation aims to guard from being too exposed to movements in individual stocks.
The recommended setting is between 0.05 and 0.1 entailing 5-10.

Neutralization is an operation used to make our strategy marketindustrysub-industry neutral.
When Neutralization  Market it does the following operation

Alpha  Alpha  meanAlpha

where Alpha is the vector of weights.

Basically, it makes the mean of the Alpha vector zero.
Thus no net position is taken with respect to the market.
In other words, the long exposure cancels out the short exposure completely, making our strategy market neutral.

When Neutralization  Industry or Subindustry, all the instruments in the Alpha vector are grouped into smaller buckets corresponding to industry or sub-industry and neutralization is applied separately to each of the buckets.
For illustration of industrysubindustry classification, see GICS note this is not necessarily the same classification standard used by BRAIN platform.

To learn more about Neutralization, refer the Neutralization FAQ section.

Pasteurization replaces input values with NaN pasteurizes for instruments not in the Alpha universe.
When Pasteurize  On, inputs to will be converted to NaN for instruments not in the universe selected in Simulation Settings.
When Pasteurize  Off, this operation does not happen and all available inputs are used.

Pasteurized data has non-NaN values only for instruments in the Alpha universe.
While pasteurized data contains less information, it may be more appropriate when considering cross-sectional or group operations.
The default Pasteurize setting is On.
Researchers can switch it to Off and use pasteurizex operator for manual pasteurization.

Example

Assume the following settings are used Universe TOP500, Pasteurize Off.
The following code calculates the difference between sector rank of sales_growth in Alpha universe and sector rank of sales_growth among all instruments

The pasteurize operator in the first group_rank pasteurizes input to the Alpha universe TOP500, while the second group_rank ranks sales_growth among all instruments.

NaNHandling replaces NaN values with other values.
If NaNHandling On, NaN values are handled based on operator type.
For time series operators, if all inputs are NaN, 0 is returned.
For group operators returning one value per group e.g.
groupmedian, groupcount, if the input value for an instrument is NaN, the value for the group is returned.

If NaNHandling  Off, NaNs are preserved.
For time series operators, if all inputs are NaN, NaN is returned.
For group operators, if the input value for an instrument is NaN, NaN is returned.
Researchers should handle NaNs manually in this case.
The default setting NaNHandling value is Off.
Some ways to manually handle NaN values can replicate On behavior.

Example

Assume NaNHandling  On.
Then for a stock with etz_eps  NaN for all 252 days, 0 is returned.
However, ts_zscorex, d also returns 0 when x  tsmeanx, d, which is different from x  NaN no data is available.
This means that NaNHandling  On increases coverage, but may introduce ambiguous information into the Alpha.

If NaNHandling  Off, NaNs can be handled other ways

is_nants_zscoreetz_eps, 252 ?
ts_zscoreest_eps, 252  ts_zscoreetz_eps, 252

Here, est_eps is used when etz_eps has NaN value for all 252 days.

Example

When NaNHandling  Off and sales is NaN for a given instrument, the operators output is NaN.
When NaNHandling  On and sales is NaN for a given instrument, the operators output is the maximum value of sales in the instruments industry.

Unit Handling option allows raising a warning when incompatible units are used in an operator.
This warning appears if expression uses data fields that are incompatible, for example, a warning will be shown for an attempt to add price to volume.

## Table of Contents

This Intermediate guide aims to further your understanding of the Alphas you have simulated.
The documentation will provide you with an in-depth understanding of commonly used operators and get you up to speed to improve your ability to create a high-performing Alpha.

Cumulative PnL Chart

If youve followed the examples in the Starter pack, chances are youve ended up with the first 2 graphs.
What both graphs have in common is that they have multiple periods of significant losses, producing a graph with high fluctuations.
This means that your simulated portfolio could lose a large percentage of its value in one day, and that wouldnt be ideal.
Rather, a good Alpha should produce a steadily rising PnL chart 3rd graph with few fluctuations and no major drawdown.

In-sample IS Summary

In-sample simulation uses data over a 5-year timeframe, and tests out how well your Alpha performs in the historical period.
After the simulation, you will see the IS Summary row with 6 metrics Sharpe, Turnover, Fitness, Returns, Drawdown, and Margin.

Sharpe

This ratio measures the excess return or risk premium per unit of deviation of returns of an Alpha.
It takes the mean of the PnL divided by the standard deviation of the PnL.
The higher the Sharpe Ratio or Information Ratio IR, the more consistent the Alphas returns are potentially likely to be, and consistency is an ideal trait.
The passing requirement for Sharpe on BRAIN is to be above 1.25.

Turnover

Turnover of an Alpha is metric that measures the simulated daily trading activity, i.e., how often the Alpha trades.
It can be defined as the ratio of value traded to book size.
The higher the turnover, the more often a trade occurs.
Since trading incurs transaction costs, reducing turnover is generally an ideal trait.
The passing requirement for turnover on BRAIN is to be between 1 and 70.

Fitness

Fitness of an Alpha is a function of Returns, Turnover  Sharpe.
Fitness is defined as

Good Alphas generally have high fitness.
You can seek to improve the performance of your Alphas by increasing Sharpe or returns and reducing turnover.
The passing requirement for fitness on BRAIN is to be greater than 1.0.

Returns

Returns is the amount made or lost by the Alpha during a defined period and is expressed in percentages.
BRAIN defines returns as

Drawdown

Drawdown of an Alpha is the largest reduction in simulated PnL during a given period, expressed as a percentage.
It is calculated as follows

Margin

Margin is the simulated profit per dollar traded of an Alpha calculated as

Thus, you can try to improve the Sub-Universe Sharpe by increasing the Universe of instruments i.e.
selecting Top3000.

Syntax error in expression.

Check your spelling of the data fields and operators and ensure that your expression is logical.
The tokens operators and keywords allowed in your Alpha expression can be found in the Available Market Data and Available Operators pages.
Alpha expressions also accept integers and floating point numbers.

Incompatible unit for input at index 0, expected Unit, found UnitCSPrice1

Unit warnings are provided for reference in simple cases and do not prevent submission.
Usually, this warning appears when data fields having two different units are added or multiplied.
E.g.
if you add close to cap.
close has units of price but cap has units of priceshares.
You can safely ignore these warnings if youre sure the Alpha correctly handles data units.

## Table of Contents

Fast expression is a proprietary programming language used by WorldQuant BRAIN that is designed to make it easier to write and test financial models.
The language can be thought as a form of pseudo code, which uses natural language and simple programming constructs to convey the logic of the algorithm.

The goal of using Fast expression on BRAIN is to provide a clear and concise way to express complex ideas and algorithms that can be easily understood by other developers and researchers.
By abstracting away the details of the underlying implementation, it can allow BRAIN users to focus on the high-level logic of their algorithms, rather than getting bogged down in the implementation details.

Just like how an English sentence consists of a subject, verb and object Fast expression can include data fields, operators and numerical values.

Data fields refer to a named collection of data, for example open price or close price.

Operators refer to a set of mathematical techniques required to implement your Alpha ideas.

Lastly, Fast expression does not have classes, objects, pointers, or functions.

In summary, Fast expression provides a clear and concise way for users to express complex ideas and algorithms.
Dont worry if youre not familiar with Fast expression yet.
With a bit of practice, we believe youll pick it up in no time!

BRAIN is a web-based tool for backtesting trading ideas.
An Alpha is a concrete trading idea that can be simulated historically.

In BRAIN, an Alpha refers to a mathematical model, written as an expression, which places different bets weights on different instruments stocks, and is expected to be profitable in the long run.
After a user enters an Alpha expression that consists of data, operators and constants, the input code is evaluated for each instrument to construct a portfolio.
Then BRAIN makes investments in each instrument for a one-day period in proportion to the values of the expression.
The process repeats each day.

The flow chart below shows the lifecycle of an Alpha

First, one might peruse blogs, journals and research papers on the internet to come up with an idea.
The Alpha expression is entered in BRAIN and operations like truncation,neutralization, decay are performed on the raw Alpha.
BRAIN makes investments goes long or short for all the instrumentsof the universe chosen in the Settings panel and the PnL is simulated.
Then the performance is calculated Sharpe, Turnover, Returns as seen in the Simulation Results page.
And if the Alpha is not deemed worthy, the Alpha idea is revised.
Else, it enters production.

In simple terms, BRAIN uses an Alpha to create a vector of weights, with each weight corresponding to one of the stocks in the selected universe.
These weights may or may not be market neutralized, as per your neutralization setting by market, industry, sub-industry or none.
This creates a portfolio for each day in the simulation period, which can then be used to calculate that days Profit and Loss PnL.

Suppose in the Expression box, you type in 1close, and set the simulation settings as follows Region  US, Universe  TOP3000, Delay  1, Decay  0, Neutralization  None, Truncation  0.
Now, once you hit Simulate button, then for each day in the Simulation Duration 5 years, the simulator does the followingIt calculates 1close using the closing price for the previous day, for each instrument in the basket US TOP3000 i.e.
top 3000 stocks in the US, by market capitalization.
This creates a vector of 3000 values one for each stock.
This vector is then normalized, i.e.
divided by the sum of its valuesso that all the values sum up to 1.
This creates a vector of weights for all the stocks, which is called a Portfolio.
Each weight represents the fraction of money invested in that stock.
If our booksize is 20 Million, then the money invested in each stock is 20M x weight of that stock in the portfolio.
This is done for each day in the simulation period, and at the end of each day the total profit or loss made by our portfolio is calculated.

BRAIN assigns positive weights to indicate long positions in stocks, and negative weights to indicate short positions in stocks.
The greater the magnitude of the weight on a stock, the larger the long or short position taken on it.

It is easy to invest 100 in stock, but negative positions shorts are common too.
E.g.
one can get 100 now by shorting a stock i.e.
investing -100, which must be bought back later.
PnL would be the opposite of 100 invested, as seen in the table below.
Negative weights are called short positions and positive weights are called long positions.
Typically investors take short positions when they expect stock price to decrease and long positions i.e.
buying stocks when they expect price to increase.
Please refer to Investopedia for more details on short selling.

The below table gives an example of payoffs from a 100 short and a 100 long position, for a 1 price change in each direction.
For simplicity, it does not account for dividends, margin and financing costs.

BRAIN is a web-based simulator of global financial markets that was created to explore Alpha research.
It accepts an Alpha expression as input and plots its Profit and Loss PnL as output.
The input expression is evaluated for each financial instrument, every day over historical dates, and a portfolio is constructed accordingly.
BRAIN invests in each financial instrument according to the value of the expression.
It takes positions either buying or short selling and assigns weights to each instrument.
The weights are then scaled to book size amount of money invested, based on which a PnL graph is plotted.
These weights are not constant they change over time based on current information and the history of the changes of some variables such as prices, volumes, etc..

How the Stock Market works

The stock market refers to public markets that exist for issuing, buying, and selling stocks that trade on a stock exchange or over-the-counter.
Stocks, also known as equities, represent fractional ownership in a company, and the stock market is a place where investors can buy and sell ownership of such investible assets 1.

Seeking Returns

Investors seek to profit from buying stocks by selling their stock for a profit if the stock price increases from their purchase price.
For example, if an investor buys shares of a companys stock at 10 a share and the price of the stock subsequently rises to 15 a share, the investor can then realize a 50 profit on their investment by selling their shares 1.
Returns is defined by WorldQuant as the return on capital traded

It signifies the amount made or lost during the period and is expressed in

Long a Stock

Taking a long position in a stock simply means buying it, and if the stock increases in value, you will make money.

Short a Stock

On the other hand, taking a short position in a stock means borrowing an equity that you do not own, usually from your broker, then selling it, and hoping that it declines in value.
When that happens, you can buy it back at a lower price than you have paid for it and return the borrowed shares to your broker.

Defining Volume

Volume is the amount of an asset or security that changes hands over some period of time, often over the course of a day.
For instance, stock trading volume could refer to the number of shares of a security traded between its daily open and close.
Trading volume, and changes to volume over the course of time, are important inputs for technical traders 2.

Defining what is Close  Open Price

The opening price is the price at which a security first trades upon the opening of an exchange on a trading day.
The closing price is the price of the final trade before the close of the trading session.
These prices are important because they are used to create traditional line stock charts, as well as when calculating moving averages and other technical indicators 3, 4.

There are many methods to determine whether to long buy a stock or to short it.
Quantitative analysis QA in finance is an approach that emphasizes mathematical and statistical analysis to help determine the value of a stock.
Quantitative trading analysts also known as quants use a variety of dataincluding historical investment and stock market datato develop trading algorithms and computer models.
The information generated by these computer models helps investors analyze investment opportunities and develop what they believe will be a successful trading strategy 5.

About BRAIN

Utilizing the quantitative analysis approach, BRAIN is a web-based simulator of global financial markets that was created to explore Alpha research.
It accepts an Alpha expression as input and plots its Profit and Loss PnL as output.

The input expression is evaluated for each financial instrument, every day over historical dates, and a portfolio is constructed accordingly.
BRAIN invests in each financial instrument according to the value of the expression.
It takes positions either buying or short selling and assigns weights to each instrument.

What is an Alpha?

An Alpha is an algorithm that transforms the input data price-volume, news, fundamental, etc.
into a vector in which values are proportional to the positions and weights we want to hold in each instrument for each day.

Weights

Imagine market data being a matrix, with each row representing one date and each column representing one stock.
For example, the matrix for close price data could look like this

Table Closing stock prices of company A, B and C for 3 respective days.

The role of the Alpha expression is to transform the input matrix to an output vector of weights, with each weight corresponding to one of the stocks.
The Alpha output vector, having weights as values corresponding to each instrument in the Universe, could look something like this

Table Output vector to indicate the direction as well as sizing for company A, B and C.

Cumulative Profit  Loss PnL

Once we have got the weights of the stock from the Alpha expression, the next step is to get each days profit and loss PnL.

From the above table, I have weight_A  0.2, weight_B  -0.5 and weight_C  0.3.
Now the amount of money I have got to invest is called the book size.
Suppose my book size is 100 USD.
So I calculate the money I want to invest in each of the stocks

money_A  0.2  100 USD  20 USD Long

money_B  -0.5  100 USD  50 USD Short

money_C  0.3  100 USD  30 USD Long

Now, I buy 20 USD worth of A, sell 50 USD worth of B and buy 30 USD worth of C.
Now I have a portfolio, which is worth a total of 100 USD.

I keep this portfolio for one full day, and sell it the next day in the simulation period.
Now in one day, the prices of stocks A, B, C have changed.
So the total value of my portfolio has also changed, say from 100 USD to 105 USD.
So, I have made a profit of 5 USD on that day.

Now I again calculate the Alpha values for the stocks, and again calculate weights, and again trade 100 USD worth of portfolio.
Note In BRAIN, we use constant book size for all the days, regardless of whether your portfolio makes money or loses money.

This is repeated for each day in the simulation period to calculate and plot the cumulative PnL.

Reducing Risk and Volatility

A good Alpha tends to ideally have consistently increasing PnL, high Annual Return, and more importantly, few fluctuations in the cumulative profit graph.
If the standard deviation is low, there tends to be lesser fluctuations in the graph.
If the graph shows high fluctuationsvolatility, despite the returns being high, the Alpha will not be deemed good enough.

WorldQuant aims to develop equity long-short market neutral Alphas that have low volatility and risk.
Such investments are attractive because they are expected to produce substantially better risk-adjusted returns than long-only portfolios.
Equity long-short market neutral strategy is used commonly by hedge funds, with the goal of minimizing exposure to the market and profit from the changes in the spread between two stocks.

Enough theory for now, lets delve into how to write your first Alpha on BRAIN.

No Coding Experience Required

To all the non-coders, the good news of using BRAIN is that no prior coding experience is required.

BRAINs Way of Coding

BRAIN uses the fast expression language that consists of two main elements Data fields and Operators.

Can I use Python  R  MATLAB etc.
for Alphas?

One of our users has asked us Are there plans to allow users to utilize PythonMATLABR to interact with the BRAIN API, to analyze datasets and submit the Alpha vectors?

Our reply is that BRAIN is currently available for use only with Fast Expressions language.
Regarding APIs, we currently do not prohibit programmatic access to BRAIN when API communication is conducted with low intensity.

Data Fields, Datasets

Data fields refer to a named collection of data, for example open price or close price.

Datasets are a collection of data fields.
For example, open price and close price can be found in the price volume dataset here.
Most users typically start out with price volume and fundamental datasets.

Operators

An Operator is a set of mathematical or statistical techniques required to implement your Alpha ideas, for example mathematical operators  -   or cross-sectional operators such as rank.
Read LearnOperators for more details.

Here are some common examples of Alphas build using data fields and operators

You can try out some sample Alphas by clicking on the Example button bottom left corner on the simulator page.
Leverage the hint and test out a few simulations!
Click here to try now Simulate Page

You might ask us, how do you come up with ideas for new Alphas?
This section will take you through two Alpha ideas utilizing technical analysis and fundamental analysis, and explain the thought process behind them.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume.
Technical analysts believe past trading activity and price changes of a security can be valuable indicators of the securitys future price movements.

Across the industry, there are hundreds of patterns and signals that have been developed by researchers to support technical analysis trading.
These include trend lines, channels, moving averages, and momentum indicators 6.

Volume as an indicator

If a companys stock has high volume, it means that many people are buying and selling the stock.
Suppose our hypothesis is that the company with more shares traded is more desirable than another company with low volume.
We will then allocate more weight to the company with higher volume.

One way to express this idea is through the Alpha expression here

Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental analysis is a method of measuring a securitys intrinsic value by examining related economic and financial factors.
Fundamental analysts study anything that can affect a securitys value, from macroeconomic factors such as the state of the economy and industry conditions to microeconomic factors like the effectiveness of the companys management.

Analysts could compare the companys growth rates to the industry and sector that it operates in, along with the other information provided, to see if the company is valued correctly 7.

Inventory Turnover

Financial ratios are ratios of fundamental data which give insights into the health and investment decisions of the company.
One common financial ratio is the inventory turnover.
It is a type of activity ratio that measures how quickly a company sells through and replaces its inventory.
It is calculated as

Sales divided by average inventory.

The hypothesis is that a stock with higher inventory turnover ratio will have a better performance and thus be allocated more weight.
The Alpha expression is as such

Time Series  Cross Sectional

Additionally, there are two frequently used operator categories time series and cross sectional.

Time series analysis can be useful to see how a given variable changes over time.
Suppose you wanted to analyze a time series of daily closing stock prices for a given stock over a period of one year.
You could obtain a list of all the closing prices for the stock from each day for the past year and analyze the time series data with technical analysis tools to know whether the stocks time series shows any seasonality.
This will help you to determine if the stock goes through peaks and troughs at regular times each year 8.

Alternatively, you can use cross-sectional analysis, where you compare a particular company to its industry peers.
Cross-sectional analysis may focus on a single company for head-to-head analysis with its biggest competitors or it may approach it from an industry-wide lens to identify companies with a particular strength.
Essentially, cross-sectional analysis shows an investor which company is best given the metrics you care about 9.

We hope youve enjoyed this guide!
To get started, you may click on the Example Button bottom left corner on the Simulate Page.
There you will find some sample Alphas with hints to improve it.

If you have any research related questions, you can check out our Community forum and post your questions there.

This section will brush you up with some basic know-how.

How the Stock Market works

The stock market refers to public markets that exist for issuing, buying, and selling stocks that trade on a stock exchange or over-the-counter.
Stocks, also known as equities, represent fractional ownership in a company, and the stock market is a place where investors can buy and sell ownership of such investible assets 1.

Seeking Returns

Investors seek to profit from buying stocks by selling their stock for a profit if the stock price increases from their purchase price.
For example, if an investor buys shares of a companys stock at 10 a share and the price of the stock subsequently rises to 15 a share, the investor can then realize a 50 profit on their investment by selling their shares 1.
Returns is defined by WorldQuant as the return on capital traded

It signifies the amount made or lost during the period and is expressed in

Long a Stock

Taking a long position in a stock simply means buying it, and if the stock increases in value, you will make money.

Short a Stock

On the other hand, taking a short position in a stock means borrowing an equity that you do not own, usually from your broker, then selling it, and hoping that it declines in value.
When that happens, you can buy it back at a lower price than you have paid for it and return the borrowed shares to your broker.

Defining Volume

Volume is the amount of an asset or security that changes hands over some period of time, often over the course of a day.
For instance, stock trading volume could refer to the number of shares of a security traded between its daily open and close.
Trading volume, and changes to volume over the course of time, are important inputs for technical traders 2.

Defining what is Close  Open Price

The opening price is the price at which a security first trades upon the opening of an exchange on a trading day.
The closing price is the price of the final trade before the close of the trading session.
These prices are important because they are used to create traditional line stock charts, as well as when calculating moving averages and other technical indicators 3, 4.

Remember the cross-sectional operators and time-series operators from the Starter pack?
You can use them here.
Secondly, you can try out different data fields.
We recommend exploring the price volume dataset, model dataset and fundamental dataset.
Lastly, you can tinker with different simulation settings.
These tips should help improve the performance of your second Alpha.

Divide

We can divide data fields with other data fields.

Imagine market data being a matrix, with each row representing one date and each column representing one stock.
For example, the matrix for close price data of stocks in universe US TOP3000 would look like this

And the matrix for open data of above stocks would look like this

Say you enter an Alpha expression like closeopen in the Simulate page found in the Alphas dropdown tab.
When you click Simulate, BRAIN will evaluate the Alpha expression against the matrix of market data for each date and each stock.

Rankx

Description the Rank operator ranks the value of the input data x for the given stock among all instruments, and returns float numbers equally distributed between 0.0 and 1.0

Alpha expression ranksalesassets.
If company B has a higher asset turnover ratio salesassets than company A, stock B may outperform stock A.
The rank operator helps to limit the extreme values of that ratio.

For example

The numbers imply that if you have 126, you must use 100 to go long stock E 80 of your total capital.
So, your strategy would depend crucially on how the last stock performs.
But, isnt that too risky?
Applying the rank function to the alpha expression ranksalesassets, you get

This time you see that the stock with the largest weight occupies only 40 of your portfolio.

Ts_rank  Ts_delta Operator

Visual Illustration of Ts_rank Operator

In your first Alpha simulation, you left the simulation settings on default.
Changing certain simulation settings may help you improve your Alpha results.
We will go through Region, Universe, Neutralization, Decay and Truncation.
The other settings will be covered in a later guide.

Region

Region refers to the market in which the Alpha will simulate trades, for example, the U.S.
equity market or Chinese equity market.

Universe

Universe is a set of trading instruments ranked by their liquidity.
For example, US TOP3000 represents the top 3,000 most liquid stocks in the U.S.
market.

Decay

Decay is used for averaging the Alpha signal within a specified time window.
The settings perform linear decay on the Alpha.
Tip Decay can be used to reduce turnover, but decay values that are too large will attenuate the signal.

Truncation

Truncation sets the maximum weight for each stock in the overall portfolio.
It aims to guard against excessive exposure to movements in individual stocks.
The recommended setting is between 0.05 and 0.1 entailing 5-10.

Neutralization

Market risks and industry specific risks are prevalent risks within equities.
However, these risks can be reduced by creating long-short neutral portfolios using a concept called neutralization.
After neutralizing the portfolios to market or industry specific groups, no net position is taken with respect to that group, i.e.
allotting the same amount of dollars in long buying and short selling positions.
That way, you are less exposed to risk, whether the entire market goes up or down.

When Neutralization  MarketIndustrySub-industry it does the following operation Alpha  Alpha  meanAlpha where Alpha is the vector of weights.

If the hypothetical book size is 20 million, we would end up investing 10 million in long positions and 10 million in short positions.
Thus, no net position is taken with respect to the market.
In other words, the long exposure cancels out the short exposure completely, making this hypothetical strategy market neutral.

The three different neutralization methods determine which groups are used for neutralizing Alpha values.
The correct choice of neutralization depends on the logic or formula used by the Alpha.
The results should indicate which neutralization will be most effective.

Say you enter an Alpha expression like closeopen in the Simulate page found in the Alphas dropdown tab.
When you click Simulate, BRAIN will evaluate the Alpha expression against the matrix of market data for each date and each stock.

Rankx

Description the Rank operator ranks the value of the input data x for the given stock among all instruments, and returns float numbers equally distributed between 0.0 and 1.0

Alpha expression ranksalesassets.
If company B has a higher asset turnover ratio salesassets than company A, stock B may outperform stock A.
The rank operator helps to limit the extreme values of that ratio.

For example

The numbers imply that if you have 126, you must use 100 to go long stock E 80 of your total capital.
So, your strategy would depend crucially on how the last stock performs.
But, isnt that too risky?
Applying the rank function to the alpha expression ranksalesassets, you get

This time you see that the stock with the largest weight occupies only 40 of your portfolio.

In your first Alpha simulation, you left the simulation settings on default.
Changing certain simulation settings may help you improve your Alpha results.
We will go through Region, Universe, Neutralization, Decay and Truncation.
The other settings will be covered in a later guide.

Region

Region refers to the market in which the Alpha will simulate trades, for example, the U.S.
equity market or Chinese equity market.

Universe

Universe is a set of trading instruments ranked by their liquidity.
For example, US TOP3000 represents the top 3,000 most liquid stocks in the U.S.
market.

Decay

Decay is used for averaging the Alpha signal within a specified time window.
The settings perform linear decay on the Alpha.
Tip Decay can be used to reduce turnover, but decay values that are too large will attenuate the signal.

Truncation

Truncation sets the maximum weight for each stock in the overall portfolio.
It aims to guard against excessive exposure to movements in individual stocks.
The recommended setting is between 0.05 and 0.1 entailing 5-10.

Neutralization

Market risks and industry specific risks are prevalent risks within equities.
However, these risks can be reduced by creating long-short neutral portfolios using a concept called neutralization.
After neutralizing the portfolios to market or industry specific groups, no net position is taken with respect to that group, i.e.
allotting the same amount of dollars in long buying and short selling positions.
That way, you are less exposed to risk, whether the entire market goes up or down.

When Neutralization  MarketIndustrySub-industry it does the following operation Alpha  Alpha  meanAlpha where Alpha is the vector of weights.

If the hypothetical book size is 20 million, we would end up investing 10 million in long positions and 10 million in short positions.
Thus, no net position is taken with respect to the market.
In other words, the long exposure cancels out the short exposure completely, making this hypothetical strategy market neutral.

The three different neutralization methods determine which groups are used for neutralizing Alpha values.
The correct choice of neutralization depends on the logic or formula used by the Alpha.
The results should indicate which neutralization will be most effective.

###### Simulation Settings

Alphas are created and simulated on the Simulate page in the Alphas dropdown tab.
To run your first simulation, click on the gear icon at the top right-hand side corner.
This will open the settings panel.
Here, select US TOP3000 for Region and Universe, Subindustry for Neutralization and apply your settings.
Make sure both Code and Result are ticked by clicking on them.
In the Alpha expression text box, enter -Deltaclose, 5 for now and click on Simulate.
The Simulation Result page will show a graph for Cumulative Profit.
This graph can be zoomed in to plot area for shorter time periods 1 month or 1 year.

The display consists of 2 graphs, one for PnL vs.
Time and the other for Sharpe Ratio vs.
Time.

In the Stats tab, a good Alpha tend to have consistently increasing PnL and high Annual Return, Sharpe Ratio,  Profitable Days and Profit per Dollar Traded.
It should have low Drawdown and Turnover.
And more importantly, it shouldnt have high fluctuations in the cumulative profit graph.
If the standard deviation is low, there tends to be lesser fluctuations in the graph.
If the graph shows high fluctuationsvolatility, despite the returns being high, the Alpha will not be deemed good enough.
An Alpha is considered to be good if

The graph above for Alpha expression -Deltaclose, 5 shows several significant drawdowns, as well as a flattening of returns in 2017.
The table below marks this Alpha as Inferior Needs Improvement.
PnL and Sharpe for 2017 drop low, and drawdown is large in 2014 and 2015.
This Alpha is Inferior Needs Improvement due to high volatility and low returns.

Use the green refreshing button in the Correlation block to get the information about the correlation of the currently simulated Alpha with the Alphas in your own OS Out-of-Sample pool.
This will be explained further in the Simulation Results page.

The image below shows the Properties of the Alpha.
You can name your Alpha, assign a category and color code, and add user-defined tags to them.
You can add a brief description about your Alpha for your reference.
Suggestion - keep the number of user-defined tags low so that they dont proliferate and are easily searchable in the My Alphas page.

To Submit Alpha for OS Test, click the Submit Alpha button in the Submission tab of the results panel.
This will check if the Alpha meets the Correlation and Sharpe criteria before submitting it.

In the Simulation result page, you will find a ratings panel in the Stats tab of Results that says Spectacular, Excellent, Good, Average or Needs Improvement depending on your Alphas Fitness as shown below

Return is the gain or loss of a security or portfolio in a particular period.
Return consists of the income received plus capital gains, relative to the amount of the investment.
In BRAIN, return  annualized PnL  half of book size.

Information ratio IR measures the prediction ability of a model.
In BRAIN, it is defined as the ratio of a portfolios mean daily returns to the volatility of those returns

where PnL is the daily profit and loss, in dollars.

Sharpe is the annualized version of the IR statistic, i.e.
Sharpe  sqrt 252IR  15.8IR where 252 is the average number of trading days days the markets are open in the USA in a year.

Sharpe or IR measures the returns of an Alpha while attempting to identify its consistency.
The higher the IR, the more consistent the Alphas returns are, and consistency is an ideal trait.
High Sharpe or IR is more desirable than just high return.

Note Sharpe and IR may be defined somewhat differently elsewhere than in BRAIN.

Fitness of an Alpha is a function of Returns, Turnover and Sharpe

Good Alphas have high fitness.
You can optimize the performance of your Alphas by increasing Sharpe or returns and reducing turnover.
Improving one factor normally has an adverse impact on the other factor.
As you work on optimizing your Alpha, an improvement in its fitness is an indication that your changes are having a positive impact.

Cumulative PnL Chart A graph shown below of an Alphas performance PnL over entire simulation.
This graph can be zoomed in by clicking and dragging below the plot area.
Start and end dates for PnL plotting can also be changed here.
Clicking the Sharpe Ratio in dropdown menu at the upper right from PnL graph displays the Sharpe ratio graph Sharpe over time.
Make sure that the PnL graph has an upward trend, the Sharpe is high and the Drawdown is kept to a minimum.

Returns The return on capital traded Annual Return  Annualized PnL  Half of Book Size.
It signifies the amount you made or lost during the period observed and is expressed in .
Book size refers to the amount of capital money used to trade during the simulation.
Book size is constant and is set to 20 million every day throughout the simulation.
Profit is not reinvested, and losses are replaced by cash injection into the portfolio.
BRAIN assumes you have 10 million and will invest in assets up to 20 million.
This is called leverage.
Performance like Returns, Sharpe is computed on a base of 10 million.

Turnover Turnover signifies how often one trades.
It can be defined as the ratio of value traded to book size.
Daily Turnover  Dollar trading volumeBook size.
Good Alphas have low turnover, since low turnover means lower transaction costs.

Margin The profit per dollar traded calculated as PnL divided by total dollars traded for a given time period.

PnL Profit and Loss PnL is the money that the positions and trades generate which means it is the amount of money you lost or made during the year, expressed in dollars.

daily_PnL  sum of size of position  daily_return for all instruments, where the daily return per instrument  todays close  yesterdays close  1.0.

Drawdown - the largest reduction in PnL during a time period, expressed as a percentage.
It is calculated as follows find the largest peak to trough drawdown in PnL, and divide its dollar amount by half of book size 1

Generate Self Correlation Clicking the Down Arrow button in a Self Correlation row will produce a table with the performance statistics of up to the 5 most correlated Alphas you submitted that qualified for OS testing.
This information is meant to help the user ensure they have a diverse set of Alphas.
This information can also be accessed by clicking on the Alpha in the Alphas page.

The rolling 5-year In-Sample simulation period begins seven years ago and ends two years ago, updating daily.
Using simulation settings, you can divide your In-Sample IS period into a Train and Test period.
The Train period can be utilized to develop your Alphas and SuperAlphas, while the Test period is ideal for validating them.
An Alpha developed based on the simulation results of training period and performs well in both periods is likely a strong candidate for submission and may have avoided overfitting.

The latest two years of data, the Semi-OS, are hidden for scoring and testing purposes.
Consultants have access to a 10-year In-sample period, instead of 5-year.

Keeping the last 2 years of data hidden leads to higher confidence in the Out-Sample OS performance of Alphas and their scores.
Statistics shown in the OS Tab of My Alphas page will be populated as data becomes available by each passing day.

Below table is for submission test for Alphas

Alphas are also tested on the distribution of Alpha weights across stocks.
Alphas can fail this test if

Sub-universe test is one of the robustness tests performed on an Alpha by the BRAIN platform before submission.
In simple words, it ensures that your Alpha works not only in the universe you are trying to submit, but that it would also work in the next more liquid or smaller universe to some extent.

E.
g.
if you are trying to submit an Alpha on USA TOP3000, the platform will also check its performance on USA TOP1000.
If it performs poorly, then it means that your Alpha is generating most of the profit on the non-liquid portion of stocks, which is one of the signs that your Alpha is not robust enough and most likely will not perform as well as expected in out-of-sample testing.
Thats why such Alphas are not allowed to be submitted on Brain.

Technical details

###### Simulation Settings


###### Simulation Settings


###### Simulation Settings

The settings panel can be found by clicking the Settings button at the top right hand corner of the Simulate page.
You can specify parameters like language, instrument type, universe, delay, neutralization, etc., which will be applied to your next simulation after clicking the Apply button.

Fast Expression is available on BRAIN.
To learn more, refer to Available Operators

Only Equity instrument type can be used at the moment

The only region currently available to all BRAIN users is the US market.
The regions Europe and Asia are currently available only to our research consultants.

Universe is a set of trading instruments prepared by BRAIN.
For example, US TOP3000 represents the top 3000 most liquid stocks in the US market determined by highest average daily dollar volume traded.

Delay refers to the availability of data, relative to decision time.
In other words, delay is the assumption of when we can trade stock once we decide on a position.

Assume that you are looking at the data today before market close and you decide that you want to buy stock.
We can choose an aggressive approach and trade stock in the time left till market close.
In this case, the position is based on data available on the same day today.
This is called Delay 0 simulation.

Alternatively, we could choose a conservative trading strategy and trade stock the next daytomorrow.
Then the position is achieved tomorrow and it is based on todays data.
In this case, there is a lag of 1 day.
This is called Delay 1 simulation.
In expression language, delay is applied automatically and you do not have to bother about it.

This performs a linear decay function over the past n days by combining todays value with previous days decayed value.
It performs the following function

Legal values for Decay Integer n where n  0.
NOTE Using negative or non-integer values for Decay will break simulations.

Tip Decay can be used to reduce turnover, but decay values that are too large will attenuate the signal.

The maximum weight for each stock in the overall portfolio.
When it is set to 0, there is no restriction.

Legal values for Truncation Float x where 0  x  1 NOTE Any values for Truncation outside this range can impactbreak simulations.

Tip Truncation aims to guard from being too exposed to movements in individual stocks.
The recommended setting is between 0.05 and 0.1 entailing 5-10.

Neutralization is an operation used to make our strategy marketindustrysub-industry neutral.
When Neutralization  Market it does the following operation

Alpha  Alpha  meanAlpha

where Alpha is the vector of weights.

Basically, it makes the mean of the Alpha vector zero.
Thus no net position is taken with respect to the market.
In other words, the long exposure cancels out the short exposure completely, making our strategy market neutral.

When Neutralization  Industry or Subindustry, all the instruments in the Alpha vector are grouped into smaller buckets corresponding to industry or sub-industry and neutralization is applied separately to each of the buckets.
For illustration of industrysubindustry classification, see GICS note this is not necessarily the same classification standard used by BRAIN platform.

To learn more about Neutralization, refer the Neutralization FAQ section.

Pasteurization replaces input values with NaN pasteurizes for instruments not in the Alpha universe.
When Pasteurize  On, inputs to will be converted to NaN for instruments not in the universe selected in Simulation Settings.
When Pasteurize  Off, this operation does not happen and all available inputs are used.

Pasteurized data has non-NaN values only for instruments in the Alpha universe.
While pasteurized data contains less information, it may be more appropriate when considering cross-sectional or group operations.
The default Pasteurize setting is On.
Researchers can switch it to Off and use pasteurizex operator for manual pasteurization.

Example

Assume the following settings are used Universe TOP500, Pasteurize Off.
The following code calculates the difference between sector rank of sales_growth in Alpha universe and sector rank of sales_growth among all instruments

The pasteurize operator in the first group_rank pasteurizes input to the Alpha universe TOP500, while the second group_rank ranks sales_growth among all instruments.

NaNHandling replaces NaN values with other values.
If NaNHandling On, NaN values are handled based on operator type.
For time series operators, if all inputs are NaN, 0 is returned.
For group operators returning one value per group e.g.
groupmedian, groupcount, if the input value for an instrument is NaN, the value for the group is returned.

If NaNHandling  Off, NaNs are preserved.
For time series operators, if all inputs are NaN, NaN is returned.
For group operators, if the input value for an instrument is NaN, NaN is returned.
Researchers should handle NaNs manually in this case.
The default setting NaNHandling value is Off.
Some ways to manually handle NaN values can replicate On behavior.

Example

Assume NaNHandling  On.
Then for a stock with etz_eps  NaN for all 252 days, 0 is returned.
However, ts_zscorex, d also returns 0 when x  tsmeanx, d, which is different from x  NaN no data is available.
This means that NaNHandling  On increases coverage, but may introduce ambiguous information into the Alpha.

If NaNHandling  Off, NaNs can be handled other ways

is_nants_zscoreetz_eps, 252 ?
ts_zscoreest_eps, 252  ts_zscoreetz_eps, 252

Here, est_eps is used when etz_eps has NaN value for all 252 days.

Example

When NaNHandling  Off and sales is NaN for a given instrument, the operators output is NaN.
When NaNHandling  On and sales is NaN for a given instrument, the operators output is the maximum value of sales in the instruments industry.

Unit Handling option allows raising a warning when incompatible units are used in an operator.
This warning appears if expression uses data fields that are incompatible, for example, a warning will be shown for an attempt to add price to volume.

###### Simulation Settings

The settings panel can be found by clicking the Settings button at the top right hand corner of the Simulate page.
You can specify parameters like language, instrument type, universe, delay, neutralization, etc., which will be applied to your next simulation after clicking the Apply button.

Fast Expression is available on BRAIN.
To learn more, refer to Available Operators

Only Equity instrument type can be used at the moment

The only region currently available to all BRAIN users is the US market.
The regions Europe and Asia are currently available only to our research consultants.

Universe is a set of trading instruments prepared by BRAIN.
For example, US TOP3000 represents the top 3000 most liquid stocks in the US market determined by highest average daily dollar volume traded.

Delay refers to the availability of data, relative to decision time.
In other words, delay is the assumption of when we can trade stock once we decide on a position.

Assume that you are looking at the data today before market close and you decide that you want to buy stock.
We can choose an aggressive approach and trade stock in the time left till market close.
In this case, the position is based on data available on the same day today.
This is called Delay 0 simulation.

Alternatively, we could choose a conservative trading strategy and trade stock the next daytomorrow.
Then the position is achieved tomorrow and it is based on todays data.
In this case, there is a lag of 1 day.
This is called Delay 1 simulation.
In expression language, delay is applied automatically and you do not have to bother about it.

This performs a linear decay function over the past n days by combining todays value with previous days decayed value.
It performs the following function

Legal values for Decay Integer n where n  0.
NOTE Using negative or non-integer values for Decay will break simulations.

Tip Decay can be used to reduce turnover, but decay values that are too large will attenuate the signal.

The maximum weight for each stock in the overall portfolio.
When it is set to 0, there is no restriction.

Legal values for Truncation Float x where 0  x  1 NOTE Any values for Truncation outside this range can impactbreak simulations.

Tip Truncation aims to guard from being too exposed to movements in individual stocks.
The recommended setting is between 0.05 and 0.1 entailing 5-10.

Neutralization is an operation used to make our strategy marketindustrysub-industry neutral.
When Neutralization  Market it does the following operation

Alpha  Alpha  meanAlpha

where Alpha is the vector of weights.

Basically, it makes the mean of the Alpha vector zero.
Thus no net position is taken with respect to the market.
In other words, the long exposure cancels out the short exposure completely, making our strategy market neutral.

When Neutralization  Industry or Subindustry, all the instruments in the Alpha vector are grouped into smaller buckets corresponding to industry or sub-industry and neutralization is applied separately to each of the buckets.
For illustration of industrysubindustry classification, see GICS note this is not necessarily the same classification standard used by BRAIN platform.

To learn more about Neutralization, refer the Neutralization FAQ section.

Pasteurization replaces input values with NaN pasteurizes for instruments not in the Alpha universe.
When Pasteurize  On, inputs to will be converted to NaN for instruments not in the universe selected in Simulation Settings.
When Pasteurize  Off, this operation does not happen and all available inputs are used.

Pasteurized data has non-NaN values only for instruments in the Alpha universe.
While pasteurized data contains less information, it may be more appropriate when considering cross-sectional or group operations.
The default Pasteurize setting is On.
Researchers can switch it to Off and use pasteurizex operator for manual pasteurization.

Example

Assume the following settings are used Universe TOP500, Pasteurize Off.
The following code calculates the difference between sector rank of sales_growth in Alpha universe and sector rank of sales_growth among all instruments

The pasteurize operator in the first group_rank pasteurizes input to the Alpha universe TOP500, while the second group_rank ranks sales_growth among all instruments.

NaNHandling replaces NaN values with other values.
If NaNHandling On, NaN values are handled based on operator type.
For time series operators, if all inputs are NaN, 0 is returned.
For group operators returning one value per group e.g.
groupmedian, groupcount, if the input value for an instrument is NaN, the value for the group is returned.

If NaNHandling  Off, NaNs are preserved.
For time series operators, if all inputs are NaN, NaN is returned.
For group operators, if the input value for an instrument is NaN, NaN is returned.
Researchers should handle NaNs manually in this case.
The default setting NaNHandling value is Off.
Some ways to manually handle NaN values can replicate On behavior.

Example

Assume NaNHandling  On.
Then for a stock with etz_eps  NaN for all 252 days, 0 is returned.
However, ts_zscorex, d also returns 0 when x  tsmeanx, d, which is different from x  NaN no data is available.
This means that NaNHandling  On increases coverage, but may introduce ambiguous information into the Alpha.

If NaNHandling  Off, NaNs can be handled other ways

is_nants_zscoreetz_eps, 252 ?
ts_zscoreest_eps, 252  ts_zscoreetz_eps, 252

Here, est_eps is used when etz_eps has NaN value for all 252 days.

Example

When NaNHandling  Off and sales is NaN for a given instrument, the operators output is NaN.
When NaNHandling  On and sales is NaN for a given instrument, the operators output is the maximum value of sales in the instruments industry.

Unit Handling option allows raising a warning when incompatible units are used in an operator.
This warning appears if expression uses data fields that are incompatible, for example, a warning will be shown for an attempt to add price to volume.

The below post illustrates in detail how the BRAIN platform works and what happens in the background when you simulate an Alpha.
Even though youll never need to do these calculations yourselves, developing an intuition for them will help you in the Alpha making process.

Imagine market data being a matrix, with each row representing one date and each column representing one stock.
For example, the matrix for close price data of stocks in universe US TOP3000 would look like this

When you input the simulation settings and click Simulate, the BRAIN platform will evaluate the Alpha expression against the matrix of market data for each date in a five year span, taking a long or short position for each financial instrument to generate the PnL chart.

Behind the scenes, seven steps, or operations, are performed before the final PnL chart is generated.

Normally, in an Alpha simulation, there would be between 200 and 3,000 stock instruments in the universe.
But to better understand this concept, well assume a hypothetical scenario in which the simulation universe has only eight stocks.
We simulate the expression rank-returns with market neutralization, Delay 1 and Decay 0 settings for now.

The hypothesis in this expression is that we want to buy, or go long on, those stocks tomorrow that had negative or comparatively lower returns today, and we want to sell, or go short on, those stocks tomorrow that had positive or comparatively higher returns today.

Weve used the rank operator, which ranks the input values inside the operator and return values equally distributed between zero and 1.
This is an example of a reversion idea.

In Column B, we have the eight stocks in the Alpha vector.
Column C shows the returns of these stocks as of February 1st.
These serve as the input data of the Alpha expression.

Step1 Evaluate the expression for each stock to generate the Alpha vector for the given date.

In our case, this date would be February 2nd, because weve assumed Delay 1 settings.
The Delay 1 setting uses data as of T-1 date to create the Alpha vector as of T date.

To produce the Alpha vector, the simulator performs the rank operation on negative returns and produces a vector of values corresponding to each stock.

The resulting vector depends on the operators used in the Alpha expression.
In our case, since weve used the rank operator, we see equally distributed values between 0 and 1 in Column D.
Note that the stock with the lowest return has the highest value, and vice versa, in line with our hypothesis.

Step 2 From each value in the vector, subtract the average of the vector values in the group.
Sum of all vector values  0.
This is called neutralization.

The group can be the entire market, but we can also perform this neutralization operation on sector, industry or subindustry groupings of stocks.

Since we have only eight stocks in our simulation universe, weve assumed to neutralize the stocks over the market.

So we take the average of the numbers in Cell D12 and subtract the average from each stock.
This gives us a new vector in Column F.
Note that both the sum and the average of these new numbers are now zero.
Also, the sum of positive values is equal to the sum of negative values.

Step 3 The resulting values are scaled or normalized such that absolute sum of the Alpha vector values is 1.
These values can be called as normalized weights.

That means, we sum the absolute values of each row and find the sum, which is 2.3.
Then we divide each row by this sum, which results in normalized values.
By normalize, we mean that the total absolute sum of Column H is 1.
We can also call this vector a normalized vector of weights.

Note On each iterationday, the expression rank-returns will have access to all the data for returns up to that day, and the matrix will grow by one line every day until it reaches the most recent date.
The role of the expression is to transform the input matrix to an output vector of weights as we see in this hypothetical example.

Step 4 Using normalized weights, the BRAIN simulator allocates capital from a fictitious book of 20 million to each stock to construct a portfolio.

Column J has a total of 20 million of fictional money allocated to the stocks, using the normalized weights in Column H.
This means we have a position of minus 4.4 million in Stock 1  that is, weve shorted 4.4 million worth of Stock 1  and a long position of 0.6 million in Stock 5.
That is, weve invested 0.6 million in Stock 5.

This is called long-short market neutralization, and its the backbone of creating these predictive models, or Alphas, on BRAIN.
With this technique, a strategy can have the potential to be profitable regardless of the direction of the market.

Step 5 Calculate next day PnL generated by the Alpha based on observed stock returns the next day

That is, after allocating dollar positions on the stocks, we calculate the PnL generated by each stock, based on the returns each stock had that day.

Suppose the actual returns on these stocks as of February 2nd are as shown in Column K.
We see that although we expected Stock 1 and Stock 2 to fall in price, they actually went up, so we had a loss, shown in Column L.

We expected Stock 6 to go up in price, but it stayed flat.
So we were wrong about three stocks, but we were right about five.
In total, we made a gain of 0.03 million on this day with our Alpha, calculated by adding the PnLs of all stocks in our vector.
This is how the simulator calculates the PnL generated by the Alpha for any given date.

Step 6 Perform the operations in Step 1 to Step 5 for each date in a several-year history span also called the In-sample period IS to get daily PnL generated for each day

For each day, the expression is evaluated and the values in the Alpha output vector represent the weights to allocate to each stock.
Alpha weights are not how much you want to buy or sell, but a weighting position you would reach this day.
These weights are multiplied by book size total money invested in the portfolio to get the dollar value held in each stock.
For example, if the Alpha weight after neutralization and scaling for MSFT is 0.2423, then well have MSFT stocks with the total value 0.2423book size.

The weight can be negative, meaning you would take a short position on these stocks.
If the value is positive, you would take a long position on these stocks, i.e.
buy the stocks.
A NAN value would mean no weight is allocated to that instrument i.e.
no money is allocated.
The value of stocks you buysell on a particular day is determined by the difference between weights today and weights yesterday.
The percentage of your portfolio traded in a day by dollar value is called turnover.
The turnover reported in simulation results is the average daily turnover over the simulation.

Step 7 Calculate the cumulative PnL of the Alpha from the start of the in-sample period to get the PnL chart of the Alpha.

Based on those daily positions, PnL is calculated and displayed.
By default, the BRAIN platform will normalize your weights according to the operations you enter and create a portfolio of 20 million total booksize worth of equity.
Note that a portfolio is just a collection of securities.

This can be better understood with the help of the PnL chart of the Alpha in our example rank-returns

In this chart, we have an IS period of five years, from February 2016 to January 2021.
Using the steps from the example, the simulator would calculate the daily PnL of the Alpha and derive the cumulative PnL chart, as we see here.
Note that the two years from February 2021 to January 2023 are not visible to us in the simulation window.
Thats called the out-of-sample, or the OS, period.
After you submit an Alpha, several tests are run to analyze the Alphas performance in the OS period.
An Alpha that passes both the in-sample and out-of-sample tests can be said to be a robust Alpha.

This is how the BRAIN simulator creates the PnL chart from an Alpha.

In our example, weve assumed that were using market neutralization and Decay 0 settings.
But if we used any other neutralization settings, the same operations would be performed on the Alpha.

Say we have 80 stocks in our simulation universe  ten industries with eight stocks each.
The simulator would perform the same operations first Step 1 to Step 5 on each of the ten groups and finally add the PnL from each group to get the daily PnL of the Alpha and create the cumulative PnL chart Step 6 and Step 7

However, if we introduce decay into our Alpha settings, an additional step must be performed to get the final Alpha vector.

Suppose we use a decay of 3 in our simulation settings.
The final vector of weights in the Alpha would be calculated by combining todays value with the previous days decayed value.
In our example, we calculated the normalized weights in the Alpha as of February 2nd.
Lets assume that the normalized weights of stocks in the Alpha vector on February 1st and January 31st are as shown in Columns N and O, respectively.

Then the final weights in the Alpha would be calculated using the given weighted average formula

which is implemented in Column P.
Using this new derived vector, the simulator would calculate the daily PnL and consequently the cumulative PnL chart.
Note that even if decay is used, more weight is assigned to the most recent values.
So decay is an important factor in reducing transaction costs or turnover, as it includes information from previous days, preventing the Alpha from being reactive.

To summarize, once we input the Alpha expression and simulation settings in the BRAIN simulator, it performs the operations discussed above to take long or short positions for each financial instrument and generates the PnL chart.

The below post illustrates in detail how the BRAIN platform works and what happens in the background when you simulate an Alpha.
Even though youll never need to do these calculations yourselves, developing an intuition for them will help you in the Alpha making process.

Imagine market data being a matrix, with each row representing one date and each column representing one stock.
For example, the matrix for close price data of stocks in universe US TOP3000 would look like this

Normally, in an Alpha simulation, there would be between 200 and 3,000 stock instruments in the universe.
But to better understand this concept, well assume a hypothetical scenario in which the simulation universe has only eight stocks.
We simulate the expression rank-returns with market neutralization, Delay 1 and Decay 0 settings for now.

The hypothesis in this expression is that we want to buy, or go long on, those stocks tomorrow that had negative or comparatively lower returns today, and we want to sell, or go short on, those stocks tomorrow that had positive or comparatively higher returns today.

Weve used the rank operator, which ranks the input values inside the operator and return values equally distributed between zero and 1.
This is an example of a reversion idea.

In Column B, we have the eight stocks in the Alpha vector.
Column C shows the returns of these stocks as of February 1st.
These serve as the input data of the Alpha expression.

Step1 Evaluate the expression for each stock to generate the Alpha vector for the given date.

In our case, this date would be February 2nd, because weve assumed Delay 1 settings.
The Delay 1 setting uses data as of T-1 date to create the Alpha vector as of T date.

To produce the Alpha vector, the simulator performs the rank operation on negative returns and produces a vector of values corresponding to each stock.

The resulting vector depends on the operators used in the Alpha expression.
In our case, since weve used the rank operator, we see equally distributed values between 0 and 1 in Column D.
Note that the stock with the lowest return has the highest value, and vice versa, in line with our hypothesis.

Step 2 From each value in the vector, subtract the average of the vector values in the group.
Sum of all vector values  0.
This is called neutralization.

The group can be the entire market, but we can also perform this neutralization operation on sector, industry or subindustry groupings of stocks.

Since we have only eight stocks in our simulation universe, weve assumed to neutralize the stocks over the market.

So we take the average of the numbers in Cell D12 and subtract the average from each stock.
This gives us a new vector in Column F.
Note that both the sum and the average of these new numbers are now zero.
Also, the sum of positive values is equal to the sum of negative values.

Step 3 The resulting values are scaled or normalized such that absolute sum of the Alpha vector values is 1.
These values can be called as normalized weights.

That means, we sum the absolute values of each row and find the sum, which is 2.3.
Then we divide each row by this sum, which results in normalized values.
By normalize, we mean that the total absolute sum of Column H is 1.
We can also call this vector a normalized vector of weights.

Note On each iterationday, the expression rank-returns will have access to all the data for returns up to that day, and the matrix will grow by one line every day until it reaches the most recent date.
The role of the expression is to transform the input matrix to an output vector of weights as we see in this hypothetical example.

Step 4 Using normalized weights, the BRAIN simulator allocates capital from a fictitious book of 20 million to each stock to construct a portfolio.

Column J has a total of 20 million of fictional money allocated to the stocks, using the normalized weights in Column H.
This means we have a position of minus 4.4 million in Stock 1  that is, weve shorted 4.4 million worth of Stock 1  and a long position of 0.6 million in Stock 5.
That is, weve invested 0.6 million in Stock 5.

This is called long-short market neutralization, and its the backbone of creating these predictive models, or Alphas, on BRAIN.
With this technique, a strategy can have the potential to be profitable regardless of the direction of the market.

Step 5 Calculate next day PnL generated by the Alpha based on observed stock returns the next day

That is, after allocating dollar positions on the stocks, we calculate the PnL generated by each stock, based on the returns each stock had that day.

Suppose the actual returns on these stocks as of February 2nd are as shown in Column K.
We see that although we expected Stock 1 and Stock 2 to fall in price, they actually went up, so we had a loss, shown in Column L.

We expected Stock 6 to go up in price, but it stayed flat.
So we were wrong about three stocks, but we were right about five.
In total, we made a gain of 0.03 million on this day with our Alpha, calculated by adding the PnLs of all stocks in our vector.
This is how the simulator calculates the PnL generated by the Alpha for any given date.

Step 6 Perform the operations in Step 1 to Step 5 for each date in a several-year history span also called the In-sample period IS to get daily PnL generated for each day

For each day, the expression is evaluated and the values in the Alpha output vector represent the weights to allocate to each stock.
Alpha weights are not how much you want to buy or sell, but a weighting position you would reach this day.
These weights are multiplied by book size total money invested in the portfolio to get the dollar value held in each stock.
For example, if the Alpha weight after neutralization and scaling for MSFT is 0.2423, then well have MSFT stocks with the total value 0.2423book size.

The weight can be negative, meaning you would take a short position on these stocks.
If the value is positive, you would take a long position on these stocks, i.e.
buy the stocks.
A NAN value would mean no weight is allocated to that instrument i.e.
no money is allocated.
The value of stocks you buysell on a particular day is determined by the difference between weights today and weights yesterday.
The percentage of your portfolio traded in a day by dollar value is called turnover.
The turnover reported in simulation results is the average daily turnover over the simulation.

Step 7 Calculate the cumulative PnL of the Alpha from the start of the in-sample period to get the PnL chart of the Alpha.

Based on those daily positions, PnL is calculated and displayed.
By default, the BRAIN platform will normalize your weights according to the operations you enter and create a portfolio of 20 million total booksize worth of equity.
Note that a portfolio is just a collection of securities.

This can be better understood with the help of the PnL chart of the Alpha in our example rank-returns

In this chart, we have an IS period of five years, from February 2016 to January 2021.
Using the steps from the example, the simulator would calculate the daily PnL of the Alpha and derive the cumulative PnL chart, as we see here.
Note that the two years from February 2021 to January 2023 are not visible to us in the simulation window.
Thats called the out-of-sample, or the OS, period.
After you submit an Alpha, several tests are run to analyze the Alphas performance in the OS period.
An Alpha that passes both the in-sample and out-of-sample tests can be said to be a robust Alpha.

This is how the BRAIN simulator creates the PnL chart from an Alpha.

In our example, weve assumed that were using market neutralization and Decay 0 settings.
But if we used any other neutralization settings, the same operations would be performed on the Alpha.

Say we have 80 stocks in our simulation universe  ten industries with eight stocks each.
The simulator would perform the same operations first Step 1 to Step 5 on each of the ten groups and finally add the PnL from each group to get the daily PnL of the Alpha and create the cumulative PnL chart Step 6 and Step 7

However, if we introduce decay into our Alpha settings, an additional step must be performed to get the final Alpha vector.

Suppose we use a decay of 3 in our simulation settings.
The final vector of weights in the Alpha would be calculated by combining todays value with the previous days decayed value.
In our example, we calculated the normalized weights in the Alpha as of February 2nd.
Lets assume that the normalized weights of stocks in the Alpha vector on February 1st and January 31st are as shown in Columns N and O, respectively.

Then the final weights in the Alpha would be calculated using the given weighted average formula

which is implemented in Column P.
Using this new derived vector, the simulator would calculate the daily PnL and consequently the cumulative PnL chart.
Note that even if decay is used, more weight is assigned to the most recent values.
So decay is an important factor in reducing transaction costs or turnover, as it includes information from previous days, preventing the Alpha from being reactive.

To summarize, once we input the Alpha expression and simulation settings in the BRAIN simulator, it performs the operations discussed above to take long or short positions for each financial instrument and generates the PnL chart.

Hypothesis

After news is released, if a stock takes a longer time to rise, it may show strong evidence of upward momentum, and it could be beneficial to take a long position in it.

Implementation

Use the fundamental data field nws12_prez_4l to capture this hypothesis.
Backfill it with two years of data to ensure there is no drop in coverage.

Hint to improve the Alpha

Can increasing weight on more liquid stocks Stocks with high volume help pass the sub-universe test?

Hypothesis

Pretax income is a good measure of a companys financial health and profitability.
Companies with increasing pretax income may have good growth prospects and higher potential for increasing stock price.
Thus, you tend to long stocks with increasing pretax income and short stocks with decreasing pretax income.

Implementation

Use the time-series rank operator to compare the trend of the fundamental data field pretax income over the past 2 years, and use the quantile operator to normalize the result.

Hints to Implement

Boost the signal with sales data.
For example, if the company has higher sales, it is more likely to outperform.

Hypothesis

If the operating income of a company is currently higher than its past 1 year history, buy the companys stock and vice-versa.

Implementation

Using ts_rank to identify current performance of the company compared to its own history, using the fundamental data field operating_income.

Hints to Implement

Rather than comparing the value directly, can calculating a ratio that includes stock market moves, improve the signal?

Hypothesis

An increase in the fair value of liabilities could indicate a higher cost than expected.
This may deteriorate the companys financial health, potentially leading to lower profitability or financial distress.

Implementation

Go short when there is an increase in the fair value of liabilities within a year and long when the opposite occurs using fundamental data.

Hints to Implement

Could observing the increase over a shorter period improve accuracy?

Hypothesis

Firms with high deferred revenue will surprise the market in the future when the deferred revenue is recognized.

Implementation

fnd6_drc field refers to deferred revenue.
To improve the coverage of the datafield, ts_backfill operator is applied.
Deferred revenue is divided by total assets to account for the size of a firm.

Hints to Implement

Instead of relying on the raw value of the ratio to decide weights of stocks, use cross-sectional operators.
Utilize group based operators to compare across similar stocks.

Hypothesis Take a long position in companies whose debt has decreased compared to the past, and conversely, take a short position in companies whose debt has increased.

Implementation Use the fundamental data debt to capture this hypothesis.
Use the time-series quantile operator to compare the trend of the fundamental data field over the past six months.

Hint to improve the Alpha Utilize the operators driver parameter to transform it into a different distribution.

Hypothesis Companies with high liability-to-asset ratios  excluding those with poor financial health or weak cashflows  often leverage debt as a strategic tool to pursue aggressive growth initiatives.
By effectively utilizing financial leverage, these firms are more likely to deliver outsized returns, as they reinvest borrowed capital into high-potential opportunities.

Implementation Use the liabilities and assets to design the ratio.

Hint to improve the Alpha This ratio can vary significantly across industries.
Would it be worth considering alternative neutralization settings?

Could observing the increase over a shorter period improve accuracy?

Hypothesis

Firms with high deferred revenue will surprise the market in the future when the deferred revenue is recognized.

Implementation

fnd6_drc field refers to deferred revenue.
To improve the coverage of the datafield, ts_backfill operator is applied.
Deferred revenue is divided by total assets to account for the size of a firm.

Hints to Implement

Instead of relying on the raw value of the ratio to decide weights of stocks, use cross-sectional operators.
Utilize group based operators to compare across similar stocks.

Hypothesis Take a long position in companies whose debt has decreased compared to the past, and conversely, take a short position in companies whose debt has increased.

Implementation Use the fundamental data debt to capture this hypothesis.
Use the time-series quantile operator to compare the trend of the fundamental data field over the past six months.

Hint to improve the Alpha Utilize the operators driver parameter to transform it into a different distribution.

Hypothesis Companies with high liability-to-asset ratios  excluding those with poor financial health or weak cashflows  often leverage debt as a strategic tool to pursue aggressive growth initiatives.
By effectively utilizing financial leverage, these firms are more likely to deliver outsized returns, as they reinvest borrowed capital into high-potential opportunities.

Implementation Use the liabilities and assets to design the ratio.

Hint to improve the Alpha This ratio can vary significantly across industries.
Would it be worth considering alternative neutralization settings?

The WorldQuant Challenge is a perpetual, online, solo competition.
Users can submit Alphas to improve their scores and ranking.

Individuals who score 10,000 points may be eligible to receive an invitation for the research consultant opportunity, subject to other criteriae.g.
if they are residents in countries where the BRAIN consultant program is offered.
Users who make it to Gold and Silver levels will have access to special training sessions and videos through the Events page.

New users are automatically enrolled into the challenge.
The Leaderboard ranks all eligible users and can be filtered by country, university andor city.

Each day, all Alphas submitted by a user accumulated and two factors are calculated

Quantity Factor Larger the number of Alphas you submit during a day.
Larger the factor, higher your score

Quality factor Quality factor is calculated as an average of the quality factor of all Alphas submitted during the day.
Larger the factor, higher your score.
It depends on the following settings and results in the in-sample period

Both factors are then normalized across all the users who submitted at least one Alpha on that particular day.
Your final daily score is then function of normalized Quantity and Quality Factors.
The daily score is capped at 2,000 points.

A named collection of data, which has constant type and business meaning.
For example, open price is of constant type numeric, and it consistently means the price of a security at the starting time of the trading period.
Close price has the same type as open price, but its a different field as it differs in business meaning.

A Dataset is a collection of Data Fields.
Dataset can be identified by its name text format, longer and explanatory or its dataset ID short alphanumeric format, only relevant for advanced scripting.

Basic type of field which has just one value of every date and instrument.
There is no special syntax for using this in simulation.
Some examples of matrix fields are close, returns, cap.

Type of field which has more than one value for every date and instrument.
Vector data fields have to be converted into matrix data fields using vector operators before using with other operators and matrix data fields.
Otherwise, an error message will be returned.

You can learn more about it here Vector data fields

A source of information on one or more variables of interest for the WorldQuant investment process.
A collection of data fields.
For example price volume data for US equities or analyst target price predictions for US equities.
See Datasets.

WorldQuant BRAIN has thousands of data fields for you to create Alphas.
But how do you quickly understand a new data field?
Here are 6 ways.
Simulate the below expressions in None neutralization and decay 0 setting.
And obtains insights of specific parameters using the Long Count and Short Count in the IS Summary section of the results.

For example, if you simulate close  0, You will see Long and Short Counts as 0.
This implies that closing price always has a positive value as expected!

Dataset Value Score is a measure which signifies underutilization of a dataset.
Consultants are advised to research and make Alphas using datasets with a higher value score.
Dont confuse this with Value Factor.

Coverage refers to the fraction of the total instruments present in the universe for which the given data field has a defined value.
Low coverage fields can be handled by making use of backfill operators like ts_backfill, kth element, group_backfill, etc.
Make use of the visualization feature to analyze the coverage of the data fields.
Read this BRAIN Forum Post to know more about coverage handling.

## Table of Contents

Powered by advanced AI technologies, such as NLP, the Data Explorer helps you quickly and accurately identify the data fields to implement your idea.

Lets say you have an Alpha idea using market sentiment.
You can easily search for related datasets and data fields in the Data Explorer.
Notice that you will have to pre-define region, delay and universe prior to your search.
Some data fields are present only in certain regions and delays.

You can filter data fields based on criteria such as coverage, type, count of Alphas and users.
For example, you can search for high coverage data fields from Company Fundamental Data for Equity dataset in CHN region and were used in at least 5 submitted Alphas.
You can later sort these data fields by Alpha count to see which fields are used less, i.e., less crowded.

While you can click on the browse by category button, you can also search for datasets using dataset category or dataset name.
This is helpful because it also allows you to filter these datasets by coverage, value score and crowdedness measured by Alpha and user count.
For example, you can search for datasets related to fundamental that have more than 100 active users.
Note that you have to go to the Datasets tab to see the results.

Try to follow the 3Ss rule keep your searches short, simple and straightforward.
Try to use terminologies within your searches to increase the chance of finding the data fields you are looking for.
In case you arent sure of the correct terminology, first try explaining it using your own words.
For example, if you are looking for insider trading data but havent quite found the phrase, try, trade by people inside company and you can achieve the results.

For some well-known concepts, try searching for the abbreviations along with the full name.
This simple practice will not only increase your chances of finding the data fields that you are looking for but you can also obtain additional options to choose from.
For example, try searching for both earnings per share and eps, both implied volatility and IV, etc.

The flowchart below is a suggested research framework with the inclusion of Data Explorer.
You can use it as a reference for creating one for yourself.

Many of our consultants started out from non-financial specializations, so dont be worried if you dont have prior financial knowledge.
This section will brush you up with some basic know-how.

How the Stock Market works

The stock market refers to public markets that exist for issuing, buying, and selling stocks that trade on a stock exchange or over-the-counter.
Stocks, also known as equities, represent fractional ownership in a company, and the stock market is a place where investors can buy and sell ownership of such investible assets 1.

Seeking Returns

Investors seek to profit from buying stocks by selling their stock for a profit if the stock price increases from their purchase price.
For example, if an investor buys shares of a companys stock at 10 a share and the price of the stock subsequently rises to 15 a share, the investor can then realize a 50 profit on their investment by selling their shares 1.
Returns is defined by WorldQuant as the return on capital traded

It signifies the amount made or lost during the period and is expressed in

Long a Stock

Taking a long position in a stock simply means buying it, and if the stock increases in value, you will make money.

Short a Stock

On the other hand, taking a short position in a stock means borrowing an equity that you do not own, usually from your broker, then selling it, and hoping that it declines in value.
When that happens, you can buy it back at a lower price than you have paid for it and return the borrowed shares to your broker.

Defining Volume

Volume is the amount of an asset or security that changes hands over some period of time, often over the course of a day.
For instance, stock trading volume could refer to the number of shares of a security traded between its daily open and close.
Trading volume, and changes to volume over the course of time, are important inputs for technical traders 2.

Defining what is Close  Open Price

The opening price is the price at which a security first trades upon the opening of an exchange on a trading day.
The closing price is the price of the final trade before the close of the trading session.
These prices are important because they are used to create traditional line stock charts, as well as when calculating moving averages and other technical indicators 3, 4.

There are many methods to determine whether to long buy a stock or to short it.
Quantitative analysis QA in finance is an approach that emphasizes mathematical and statistical analysis to help determine the value of a stock.
Quantitative trading analysts also known as quants use a variety of dataincluding historical investment and stock market datato develop trading algorithms and computer models.
The information generated by these computer models helps investors analyze investment opportunities and develop what they believe will be a successful trading strategy 5.

About BRAIN

Utilizing the quantitative analysis approach, BRAIN is a web-based simulator of global financial markets that was created to explore Alpha research.
It accepts an Alpha expression as input and plots its Profit and Loss PnL as output.

The input expression is evaluated for each financial instrument, every day over historical dates, and a portfolio is constructed accordingly.
BRAIN invests in each financial instrument according to the value of the expression.
It takes positions either buying or short selling and assigns weights to each instrument.

What is an Alpha?

An Alpha is an algorithm that transforms the input data price-volume, news, fundamental, etc.
into a vector in which values are proportional to the positions and weights we want to hold in each instrument for each day.

Weights

Imagine market data being a matrix, with each row representing one date and each column representing one stock.
For example, the matrix for close price data could look like this

Table Closing stock prices of company A, B and C for 3 respective days.

The role of the Alpha expression is to transform the input matrix to an output vector of weights, with each weight corresponding to one of the stocks.
The Alpha output vector, having weights as values corresponding to each instrument in the Universe, could look something like this

Table Output vector to indicate the direction as well as sizing for company A, B and C.

Cumulative Profit  Loss PnL

Once we have got the weights of the stock from the Alpha expression, the next step is to get each days profit and loss PnL.

From the above table, I have weight_A  0.2, weight_B  -0.5 and weight_C  0.3.
Now the amount of money I have got to invest is called the book size.
Suppose my book size is 100 USD.
So I calculate the money I want to invest in each of the stocks

money_A  0.2  100 USD  20 USD Long

money_B  -0.5  100 USD  50 USD Short

money_C  0.3  100 USD  30 USD Long

Now, I buy 20 USD worth of A, sell 50 USD worth of B and buy 30 USD worth of C.
Now I have a portfolio, which is worth a total of 100 USD.

I keep this portfolio for one full day, and sell it the next day in the simulation period.
Now in one day, the prices of stocks A, B, C have changed.
So the total value of my portfolio has also changed, say from 100 USD to 105 USD.
So, I have made a profit of 5 USD on that day.

Now I again calculate the Alpha values for the stocks, and again calculate weights, and again trade 100 USD worth of portfolio.
Note In BRAIN, we use constant book size for all the days, regardless of whether your portfolio makes money or loses money.

This is repeated for each day in the simulation period to calculate and plot the cumulative PnL.

Reducing Risk and Volatility

A good Alpha tends to ideally have consistently increasing PnL, high Annual Return, and more importantly, few fluctuations in the cumulative profit graph.
If the standard deviation is low, there tends to be lesser fluctuations in the graph.
If the graph shows high fluctuationsvolatility, despite the returns being high, the Alpha will not be deemed good enough.

WorldQuant aims to develop equity long-short market neutral Alphas that have low volatility and risk.
Such investments are attractive because they are expected to produce substantially better risk-adjusted returns than long-only portfolios.
Equity long-short market neutral strategy is used commonly by hedge funds, with the goal of minimizing exposure to the market and profit from the changes in the spread between two stocks.

Enough theory for now, lets delve into how to write your first Alpha on BRAIN.

No Coding Experience Required

To all the non-coders, the good news of using BRAIN is that no prior coding experience is required.

BRAINs Way of Coding

BRAIN uses the fast expression language that consists of two main elements Data fields and Operators.

Can I use Python  R  MATLAB etc.
for Alphas?

One of our users has asked us Are there plans to allow users to utilize PythonMATLABR to interact with the BRAIN API, to analyze datasets and submit the Alpha vectors?

Our reply is that BRAIN is currently available for use only with Fast Expressions language.
Regarding APIs, we currently do not prohibit programmatic access to BRAIN when API communication is conducted with low intensity.

Data Fields, Datasets

Data fields refer to a named collection of data, for example open price or close price.

Datasets are a collection of data fields.
For example, open price and close price can be found in the price volume dataset here.
Most users typically start out with price volume and fundamental datasets.

Operators

An Operator is a set of mathematical or statistical techniques required to implement your Alpha ideas, for example mathematical operators  -   or cross-sectional operators such as rank.
Read LearnOperators for more details.

Here are some common examples of Alphas build using data fields and operators

You can try out some sample Alphas by clicking on the Example button bottom left corner on the simulator page.
Leverage the hint and test out a few simulations!
Click here to try now Simulate Page

You might ask us, how do you come up with ideas for new Alphas?
This section will take you through two Alpha ideas utilizing technical analysis and fundamental analysis, and explain the thought process behind them.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume.
Technical analysts believe past trading activity and price changes of a security can be valuable indicators of the securitys future price movements.

Across the industry, there are hundreds of patterns and signals that have been developed by researchers to support technical analysis trading.
These include trend lines, channels, moving averages, and momentum indicators 6.

Volume as an indicator

If a companys stock has high volume, it means that many people are buying and selling the stock.
Suppose our hypothesis is that the company with more shares traded is more desirable than another company with low volume.
We will then allocate more weight to the company with higher volume.

One way to express this idea is through the Alpha expression here

Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental analysis is a method of measuring a securitys intrinsic value by examining related economic and financial factors.
Fundamental analysts study anything that can affect a securitys value, from macroeconomic factors such as the state of the economy and industry conditions to microeconomic factors like the effectiveness of the companys management.

Analysts could compare the companys growth rates to the industry and sector that it operates in, along with the other information provided, to see if the company is valued correctly 7.

Inventory Turnover

Financial ratios are ratios of fundamental data which give insights into the health and investment decisions of the company.
One common financial ratio is the inventory turnover.
It is a type of activity ratio that measures how quickly a company sells through and replaces its inventory.
It is calculated as

Sales divided by average inventory.

The hypothesis is that a stock with higher inventory turnover ratio will have a better performance and thus be allocated more weight.
The Alpha expression is as such

Time Series  Cross Sectional

Additionally, there are two frequently used operator categories time series and cross sectional.

Time series analysis can be useful to see how a given variable changes over time.
Suppose you wanted to analyze a time series of daily closing stock prices for a given stock over a period of one year.
You could obtain a list of all the closing prices for the stock from each day for the past year and analyze the time series data with technical analysis tools to know whether the stocks time series shows any seasonality.
This will help you to determine if the stock goes through peaks and troughs at regular times each year 8.

Alternatively, you can use cross-sectional analysis, where you compare a particular company to its industry peers.
Cross-sectional analysis may focus on a single company for head-to-head analysis with its biggest competitors or it may approach it from an industry-wide lens to identify companies with a particular strength.
Essentially, cross-sectional analysis shows an investor which company is best given the metrics you care about 9.

This section will brush you up with some basic know-how.

How the Stock Market works

The stock market refers to public markets that exist for issuing, buying, and selling stocks that trade on a stock exchange or over-the-counter.
Stocks, also known as equities, represent fractional ownership in a company, and the stock market is a place where investors can buy and sell ownership of such investible assets 1.

Seeking Returns

Investors seek to profit from buying stocks by selling their stock for a profit if the stock price increases from their purchase price.
For example, if an investor buys shares of a companys stock at 10 a share and the price of the stock subsequently rises to 15 a share, the investor can then realize a 50 profit on their investment by selling their shares 1.
Returns is defined by WorldQuant as the return on capital traded

It signifies the amount made or lost during the period and is expressed in

Long a Stock

Taking a long position in a stock simply means buying it, and if the stock increases in value, you will make money.

Short a Stock

On the other hand, taking a short position in a stock means borrowing an equity that you do not own, usually from your broker, then selling it, and hoping that it declines in value.
When that happens, you can buy it back at a lower price than you have paid for it and return the borrowed shares to your broker.

Defining Volume

Volume is the amount of an asset or security that changes hands over some period of time, often over the course of a day.
For instance, stock trading volume could refer to the number of shares of a security traded between its daily open and close.
Trading volume, and changes to volume over the course of time, are important inputs for technical traders 2.

Defining what is Close  Open Price

The opening price is the price at which a security first trades upon the opening of an exchange on a trading day.
The closing price is the price of the final trade before the close of the trading session.
These prices are important because they are used to create traditional line stock charts, as well as when calculating moving averages and other technical indicators 3, 4.

There are many methods to determine whether to long buy a stock or to short it.
Quantitative analysis QA in finance is an approach that emphasizes mathematical and statistical analysis to help determine the value of a stock.
Quantitative trading analysts also known as quants use a variety of dataincluding historical investment and stock market datato develop trading algorithms and computer models.
The information generated by these computer models helps investors analyze investment opportunities and develop what they believe will be a successful trading strategy 5.

About BRAIN

Utilizing the quantitative analysis approach, BRAIN is a web-based simulator of global financial markets that was created to explore Alpha research.
It accepts an Alpha expression as input and plots its Profit and Loss PnL as output.

The input expression is evaluated for each financial instrument, every day over historical dates, and a portfolio is constructed accordingly.
BRAIN invests in each financial instrument according to the value of the expression.
It takes positions either buying or short selling and assigns weights to each instrument.

What is an Alpha?

An Alpha is an algorithm that transforms the input data price-volume, news, fundamental, etc.
into a vector in which values are proportional to the positions and weights we want to hold in each instrument for each day.

Weights

Imagine market data being a matrix, with each row representing one date and each column representing one stock.
For example, the matrix for close price data could look like this

Table Closing stock prices of company A, B and C for 3 respective days.

The role of the Alpha expression is to transform the input matrix to an output vector of weights, with each weight corresponding to one of the stocks.
The Alpha output vector, having weights as values corresponding to each instrument in the Universe, could look something like this

Table Output vector to indicate the direction as well as sizing for company A, B and C.

Cumulative Profit  Loss PnL

Once we have got the weights of the stock from the Alpha expression, the next step is to get each days profit and loss PnL.

From the above table, I have weight_A  0.2, weight_B  -0.5 and weight_C  0.3.
Now the amount of money I have got to invest is called the book size.
Suppose my book size is 100 USD.
So I calculate the money I want to invest in each of the stocks

money_A  0.2  100 USD  20 USD Long

money_B  -0.5  100 USD  50 USD Short

money_C  0.3  100 USD  30 USD Long

Now, I buy 20 USD worth of A, sell 50 USD worth of B and buy 30 USD worth of C.
Now I have a portfolio, which is worth a total of 100 USD.

I keep this portfolio for one full day, and sell it the next day in the simulation period.
Now in one day, the prices of stocks A, B, C have changed.
So the total value of my portfolio has also changed, say from 100 USD to 105 USD.
So, I have made a profit of 5 USD on that day.

Now I again calculate the Alpha values for the stocks, and again calculate weights, and again trade 100 USD worth of portfolio.
Note In BRAIN, we use constant book size for all the days, regardless of whether your portfolio makes money or loses money.

This is repeated for each day in the simulation period to calculate and plot the cumulative PnL.

Reducing Risk and Volatility

A good Alpha tends to ideally have consistently increasing PnL, high Annual Return, and more importantly, few fluctuations in the cumulative profit graph.
If the standard deviation is low, there tends to be lesser fluctuations in the graph.
If the graph shows high fluctuationsvolatility, despite the returns being high, the Alpha will not be deemed good enough.

WorldQuant aims to develop equity long-short market neutral Alphas that have low volatility and risk.
Such investments are attractive because they are expected to produce substantially better risk-adjusted returns than long-only portfolios.
Equity long-short market neutral strategy is used commonly by hedge funds, with the goal of minimizing exposure to the market and profit from the changes in the spread between two stocks.

Enough theory for now, lets delve into how to write your first Alpha on BRAIN.

No Coding Experience Required

To all the non-coders, the good news of using BRAIN is that no prior coding experience is required.

BRAINs Way of Coding

BRAIN uses the fast expression language that consists of two main elements Data fields and Operators.

Can I use Python  R  MATLAB etc.
for Alphas?

One of our users has asked us Are there plans to allow users to utilize PythonMATLABR to interact with the BRAIN API, to analyze datasets and submit the Alpha vectors?

Our reply is that BRAIN is currently available for use only with Fast Expressions language.
Regarding APIs, we currently do not prohibit programmatic access to BRAIN when API communication is conducted with low intensity.

Data Fields, Datasets

Data fields refer to a named collection of data, for example open price or close price.

Datasets are a collection of data fields.
For example, open price and close price can be found in the price volume dataset here.
Most users typically start out with price volume and fundamental datasets.

Operators

An Operator is a set of mathematical or statistical techniques required to implement your Alpha ideas, for example mathematical operators  -   or cross-sectional operators such as rank.
Read LearnOperators for more details.

Here are some common examples of Alphas build using data fields and operators

You can try out some sample Alphas by clicking on the Example button bottom left corner on the simulator page.
Leverage the hint and test out a few simulations!

You might ask us, how do you come up with ideas for new Alphas?
This section will take you through two Alpha ideas utilizing technical analysis and fundamental analysis, and explain the thought process behind them.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume.
Technical analysts believe past trading activity and price changes of a security can be valuable indicators of the securitys future price movements.

Across the industry, there are hundreds of patterns and signals that have been developed by researchers to support technical analysis trading.
These include trend lines, channels, moving averages, and momentum indicators 6.

Volume as an indicator

If a companys stock has high volume, it means that many people are buying and selling the stock.
Suppose our hypothesis is that the company with more shares traded is more desirable than another company with low volume.
We will then allocate more weight to the company with higher volume.

One way to express this idea is through the Alpha expression here

Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental analysis is a method of measuring a securitys intrinsic value by examining related economic and financial factors.
Fundamental analysts study anything that can affect a securitys value, from macroeconomic factors such as the state of the economy and industry conditions to microeconomic factors like the effectiveness of the companys management.

BRAIN is a web-based tool for backtesting trading ideas.
An Alpha is a concrete trading idea that can be simulated historically.

In BRAIN, an Alpha refers to a mathematical model, written as an expression, which places different bets weights on different instruments stocks, and is expected to be profitable in the long run.
After a user enters an Alpha expression that consists of data, operators and constants, the input code is evaluated for each instrument to construct a portfolio.
Then BRAIN makes investments in each instrument for a one-day period in proportion to the values of the expression.
The process repeats each day.

The flow chart below shows the lifecycle of an Alpha

First, one might peruse blogs, journals and research papers on the internet to come up with an idea.
The Alpha expression is entered in BRAIN and operations like truncation,neutralization, decay are performed on the raw Alpha.
BRAIN makes investments goes long or short for all the instrumentsof the universe chosen in the Settings panel and the PnL is simulated.
Then the performance is calculated Sharpe, Turnover, Returns as seen in the Simulation Results page.
And if the Alpha is not deemed worthy, the Alpha idea is revised.
Else, it enters production.

In simple terms, BRAIN uses an Alpha to create a vector of weights, with each weight corresponding to one of the stocks in the selected universe.
These weights may or may not be market neutralized, as per your neutralization setting by market, industry, sub-industry or none.
This creates a portfolio for each day in the simulation period, which can then be used to calculate that days Profit and Loss PnL.

Suppose in the Expression box, you type in 1close, and set the simulation settings as follows Region  US, Universe  TOP3000, Delay  1, Decay  0, Neutralization  None, Truncation  0.
Now, once you hit Simulate button, then for each day in the Simulation Duration 5 years, the simulator does the followingIt calculates 1close using the closing price for the previous day, for each instrument in the basket US TOP3000 i.e.
top 3000 stocks in the US, by market capitalization.
This creates a vector of 3000 values one for each stock.
This vector is then normalized, i.e.
divided by the sum of its valuesso that all the values sum up to 1.
This creates a vector of weights for all the stocks, which is called a Portfolio.
Each weight represents the fraction of money invested in that stock.
If our booksize is 20 Million, then the money invested in each stock is 20M x weight of that stock in the portfolio.
This is done for each day in the simulation period, and at the end of each day the total profit or loss made by our portfolio is calculated.

BRAIN assigns positive weights to indicate long positions in stocks, and negative weights to indicate short positions in stocks.
The greater the magnitude of the weight on a stock, the larger the long or short position taken on it.

It is easy to invest 100 in stock, but negative positions shorts are common too.
E.g.
one can get 100 now by shorting a stock i.e.
investing -100, which must be bought back later.
PnL would be the opposite of 100 invested, as seen in the table below.
Negative weights are called short positions and positive weights are called long positions.
Typically investors take short positions when they expect stock price to decrease and long positions i.e.
buying stocks when they expect price to increase.
Please refer to Investopedia for more details on short selling.

The below table gives an example of payoffs from a 100 short and a 100 long position, for a 1 price change in each direction.
For simplicity, it does not account for dividends, margin and financing costs.

BRAIN is a web-based simulator of global financial markets that was created to explore Alpha research.
It accepts an Alpha expression as input and plots its Profit and Loss PnL as output.
The input expression is evaluated for each financial instrument, every day over historical dates, and a portfolio is constructed accordingly.
BRAIN invests in each financial instrument according to the value of the expression.
It takes positions either buying or short selling and assigns weights to each instrument.
The weights are then scaled to book size amount of money invested, based on which a PnL graph is plotted.
These weights are not constant they change over time based on current information and the history of the changes of some variables such as prices, volumes, etc..

Fast expression is a proprietary programming language used by WorldQuant BRAIN that is designed to make it easier to write and test financial models.
The language can be thought as a form of pseudo code, which uses natural language and simple programming constructs to convey the logic of the algorithm.

The goal of using Fast expression on BRAIN is to provide a clear and concise way to express complex ideas and algorithms that can be easily understood by other developers and researchers.
By abstracting away the details of the underlying implementation, it can allow BRAIN users to focus on the high-level logic of their algorithms, rather than getting bogged down in the implementation details.

Just like how an English sentence consists of a subject, verb and object Fast expression can include data fields, operators and numerical values.

Data fields refer to a named collection of data, for example open price or close price.

Operators refer to a set of mathematical techniques required to implement your Alpha ideas.

Lastly, Fast expression does not have classes, objects, pointers, or functions.

In summary, Fast expression provides a clear and concise way for users to express complex ideas and algorithms.
Dont worry if youre not familiar with Fast expression yet.
With a bit of practice, we believe youll pick it up in no time!

This Intermediate guide aims to further your understanding of the Alphas you have simulated.
The documentation will provide you with an in-depth understanding of commonly used operators and get you up to speed to improve your ability to create a high-performing Alpha.

Cumulative PnL Chart

If youve followed the examples in the Starter pack, chances are youve ended up with the first 2 graphs.
What both graphs have in common is that they have multiple periods of significant losses, producing a graph with high fluctuations.
This means that your simulated portfolio could lose a large percentage of its value in one day, and that wouldnt be ideal.
Rather, a good Alpha should produce a steadily rising PnL chart 3rd graph with few fluctuations and no major drawdown.

In-sample IS Summary

In-sample simulation uses data over a 5-year timeframe, and tests out how well your Alpha performs in the historical period.
After the simulation, you will see the IS Summary row with 6 metrics Sharpe, Turnover, Fitness, Returns, Drawdown, and Margin.

Sharpe

This ratio measures the excess return or risk premium per unit of deviation of returns of an Alpha.
It takes the mean of the PnL divided by the standard deviation of the PnL.
The higher the Sharpe Ratio or Information Ratio IR, the more consistent the Alphas returns are potentially likely to be, and consistency is an ideal trait.
The passing requirement for Sharpe on BRAIN is to be above 1.25.

Turnover

Turnover of an Alpha is metric that measures the simulated daily trading activity, i.e., how often the Alpha trades.
It can be defined as the ratio of value traded to book size.
The higher the turnover, the more often a trade occurs.
Since trading incurs transaction costs, reducing turnover is generally an ideal trait.
The passing requirement for turnover on BRAIN is to be between 1 and 70.

Fitness

Fitness of an Alpha is a function of Returns, Turnover  Sharpe.
Fitness is defined as

Good Alphas generally have high fitness.
You can seek to improve the performance of your Alphas by increasing Sharpe or returns and reducing turnover.
The passing requirement for fitness on BRAIN is to be greater than 1.0.

Returns

Returns is the amount made or lost by the Alpha during a defined period and is expressed in percentages.
BRAIN defines returns as

Drawdown

Drawdown of an Alpha is the largest reduction in simulated PnL during a given period, expressed as a percentage.
It is calculated as follows

Margin

Margin is the simulated profit per dollar traded of an Alpha calculated as

Thus, you can try to improve the Sub-Universe Sharpe by increasing the Universe of instruments i.e.
selecting Top3000.

Syntax error in expression.

Check your spelling of the data fields and operators and ensure that your expression is logical.
The tokens operators and keywords allowed in your Alpha expression can be found in the Available Market Data and Available Operators pages.
Alpha expressions also accept integers and floating point numbers.

Incompatible unit for input at index 0, expected Unit, found UnitCSPrice1

Unit warnings are provided for reference in simple cases and do not prevent submission.
Usually, this warning appears when data fields having two different units are added or multiplied.
E.g.
if you add close to cap.
close has units of price but cap has units of priceshares.
You can safely ignore these warnings if youre sure the Alpha correctly handles data units.

Remember the cross-sectional operators and time-series operators from the Starter pack?
You can use them here.
Secondly, you can try out different data fields.
We recommend exploring the price volume dataset, model dataset and fundamental dataset.
Lastly, you can tinker with different simulation settings.
These tips should help improve the performance of your second Alpha.

Divide

We can divide data fields with other data fields.

Imagine market data being a matrix, with each row representing one date and each column representing one stock.
For example, the matrix for close price data of stocks in universe US TOP3000 would look like this

And the matrix for open data of above stocks would look like this

Say you enter an Alpha expression like closeopen in the Simulate page found in the Alphas dropdown tab.
When you click Simulate, BRAIN will evaluate the Alpha expression against the matrix of market data for each date and each stock.

Rankx

Description the Rank operator ranks the value of the input data x for the given stock among all instruments, and returns float numbers equally distributed between 0.0 and 1.0

Alpha expression ranksalesassets.
If company B has a higher asset turnover ratio salesassets than company A, stock B may outperform stock A.
The rank operator helps to limit the extreme values of that ratio.

For example

The numbers imply that if you have 126, you must use 100 to go long stock E 80 of your total capital.
So, your strategy would depend crucially on how the last stock performs.
But, isnt that too risky?
Applying the rank function to the alpha expression ranksalesassets, you get

This time you see that the stock with the largest weight occupies only 40 of your portfolio.

Ts_rank  Ts_delta Operator

Visual Illustration of Ts_rank Operator

In your first Alpha simulation, you left the simulation settings on default.
Changing certain simulation settings may help you improve your Alpha results.
We will go through Region, Universe, Neutralization, Decay and Truncation.
The other settings will be covered in a later guide.

Region

Region refers to the market in which the Alpha will simulate trades, for example, the U.S.
equity market or Chinese equity market.

Universe

Universe is a set of trading instruments ranked by their liquidity.
For example, US TOP3000 represents the top 3,000 most liquid stocks in the U.S.
market.

Decay

Decay is used for averaging the Alpha signal within a specified time window.
The settings perform linear decay on the Alpha.
Tip Decay can be used to reduce turnover, but decay values that are too large will attenuate the signal.

Truncation

Truncation sets the maximum weight for each stock in the overall portfolio.
It aims to guard against excessive exposure to movements in individual stocks.
The recommended setting is between 0.05 and 0.1 entailing 5-10.

Neutralization

Market risks and industry specific risks are prevalent risks within equities.
However, these risks can be reduced by creating long-short neutral portfolios using a concept called neutralization.
After neutralizing the portfolios to market or industry specific groups, no net position is taken with respect to that group, i.e.
allotting the same amount of dollars in long buying and short selling positions.
That way, you are less exposed to risk, whether the entire market goes up or down.

When Neutralization  MarketIndustrySub-industry it does the following operation Alpha  Alpha  meanAlpha where Alpha is the vector of weights.

If the hypothetical book size is 20 million, we would end up investing 10 million in long positions and 10 million in short positions.
Thus, no net position is taken with respect to the market.
In other words, the long exposure cancels out the short exposure completely, making this hypothetical strategy market neutral.

The three different neutralization methods determine which groups are used for neutralizing Alpha values.
The correct choice of neutralization depends on the logic or formula used by the Alpha.
The results should indicate which neutralization will be most effective.

Hypothesis

After news is released, if a stock takes a longer time to rise, it may show strong evidence of upward momentum, and it could be beneficial to take a long position in it.

Implementation

Use the fundamental data field nws12_prez_4l to capture this hypothesis.
Backfill it with two years of data to ensure there is no drop in coverage.

Hint to improve the Alpha

Can increasing weight on more liquid stocks Stocks with high volume help pass the sub-universe test?

Hypothesis

Pretax income is a good measure of a companys financial health and profitability.
Companies with increasing pretax income may have good growth prospects and higher potential for increasing stock price.
Thus, you tend to long stocks with increasing pretax income and short stocks with decreasing pretax income.

Implementation

Use the time-series rank operator to compare the trend of the fundamental data field pretax income over the past 2 years, and use the quantile operator to normalize the result.

Hints to Implement

Boost the signal with sales data.
For example, if the company has higher sales, it is more likely to outperform.

Hypothesis

If the operating income of a company is currently higher than its past 1 year history, buy the companys stock and vice-versa.

Implementation

Using ts_rank to identify current performance of the company compared to its own history, using the fundamental data field operating_income.

Hints to Implement

Rather than comparing the value directly, can calculating a ratio that includes stock market moves, improve the signal?

Hypothesis

An increase in the fair value of liabilities could indicate a higher cost than expected.
This may deteriorate the companys financial health, potentially leading to lower profitability or financial distress.

Implementation

Go short when there is an increase in the fair value of liabilities within a year and long when the opposite occurs using fundamental data.

Hints to Implement

Could observing the increase over a shorter period improve accuracy?

Hypothesis

Firms with high deferred revenue will surprise the market in the future when the deferred revenue is recognized.

Implementation

fnd6_drc field refers to deferred revenue.
To improve the coverage of the datafield, ts_backfill operator is applied.
Deferred revenue is divided by total assets to account for the size of a firm.

Hints to Implement

Instead of relying on the raw value of the ratio to decide weights of stocks, use cross-sectional operators.
Utilize group based operators to compare across similar stocks.

Hypothesis Take a long position in companies whose debt has decreased compared to the past, and conversely, take a short position in companies whose debt has increased.

Implementation Use the fundamental data debt to capture this hypothesis.
Use the time-series quantile operator to compare the trend of the fundamental data field over the past six months.

Hint to improve the Alpha Utilize the operators driver parameter to transform it into a different distribution.

Hypothesis Companies with high liability-to-asset ratios  excluding those with poor financial health or weak cashflows  often leverage debt as a strategic tool to pursue aggressive growth initiatives.
By effectively utilizing financial leverage, these firms are more likely to deliver outsized returns, as they reinvest borrowed capital into high-potential opportunities.

Implementation Use the liabilities and assets to design the ratio.

Hint to improve the Alpha This ratio can vary significantly across industries.
Would it be worth considering alternative neutralization settings?

## Source: file://20250416_161226_simulate_learn_documentation_create-alphas_how-brain-platform-works.html

The below post illustrates in detail how the BRAIN platform works and what happens in the background when you simulate an Alpha.
Even though youll never need to do these calculations yourselves, developing an intuition for them will help you in the Alpha making process.

Imagine market data being a matrix, with each row representing one date and each column representing one stock.
For example, the matrix for close price data of stocks in universe US TOP3000 would look like this

When you input the simulation settings and click Simulate, the BRAIN platform will evaluate the Alpha expression against the matrix of market data for each date in a five year span, taking a long or short position for each financial instrument to generate the PnL chart.

Behind the scenes, seven steps, or operations, are performed before the final PnL chart is generated.

Normally, in an Alpha simulation, there would be between 200 and 3,000 stock instruments in the universe.
But to better understand this concept, well assume a hypothetical scenario in which the simulation universe has only eight stocks.
We simulate the expression rank-returns with market neutralization, Delay 1 and Decay 0 settings for now.

The hypothesis in this expression is that we want to buy, or go long on, those stocks tomorrow that had negative or comparatively lower returns today, and we want to sell, or go short on, those stocks tomorrow that had positive or comparatively higher returns today.

Weve used the rank operator, which ranks the input values inside the operator and return values equally distributed between zero and 1.
This is an example of a reversion idea.

In Column B, we have the eight stocks in the Alpha vector.
Column C shows the returns of these stocks as of February 1st.
These serve as the input data of the Alpha expression.

Step1 Evaluate the expression for each stock to generate the Alpha vector for the given date.

In our case, this date would be February 2nd, because weve assumed Delay 1 settings.
The Delay 1 setting uses data as of T-1 date to create the Alpha vector as of T date.

To produce the Alpha vector, the simulator performs the rank operation on negative returns and produces a vector of values corresponding to each stock.

The resulting vector depends on the operators used in the Alpha expression.
In our case, since weve used the rank operator, we see equally distributed values between 0 and 1 in Column D.
Note that the stock with the lowest return has the highest value, and vice versa, in line with our hypothesis.

Step 2 From each value in the vector, subtract the average of the vector values in the group.
Sum of all vector values  0.
This is called neutralization.

The group can be the entire market, but we can also perform this neutralization operation on sector, industry or subindustry groupings of stocks.

Since we have only eight stocks in our simulation universe, weve assumed to neutralize the stocks over the market.

So we take the average of the numbers in Cell D12 and subtract the average from each stock.
This gives us a new vector in Column F.
Note that both the sum and the average of these new numbers are now zero.
Also, the sum of positive values is equal to the sum of negative values.

Step 3 The resulting values are scaled or normalized such that absolute sum of the Alpha vector values is 1.
These values can be called as normalized weights.

That means, we sum the absolute values of each row and find the sum, which is 2.3.
Then we divide each row by this sum, which results in normalized values.
By normalize, we mean that the total absolute sum of Column H is 1.
We can also call this vector a normalized vector of weights.

Note On each iterationday, the expression rank-returns will have access to all the data for returns up to that day, and the matrix will grow by one line every day until it reaches the most recent date.
The role of the expression is to transform the input matrix to an output vector of weights as we see in this hypothetical example.

Step 4 Using normalized weights, the BRAIN simulator allocates capital from a fictitious book of 20 million to each stock to construct a portfolio.

Column J has a total of 20 million of fictional money allocated to the stocks, using the normalized weights in Column H.
This means we have a position of minus 4.4 million in Stock 1  that is, weve shorted 4.4 million worth of Stock 1  and a long position of 0.6 million in Stock 5.
That is, weve invested 0.6 million in Stock 5.

This is called long-short market neutralization, and its the backbone of creating these predictive models, or Alphas, on BRAIN.
With this technique, a strategy can have the potential to be profitable regardless of the direction of the market.

Step 5 Calculate next day PnL generated by the Alpha based on observed stock returns the next day

That is, after allocating dollar positions on the stocks, we calculate the PnL generated by each stock, based on the returns each stock had that day.

Suppose the actual returns on these stocks as of February 2nd are as shown in Column K.
We see that although we expected Stock 1 and Stock 2 to fall in price, they actually went up, so we had a loss, shown in Column L.

We expected Stock 6 to go up in price, but it stayed flat.
So we were wrong about three stocks, but we were right about five.
In total, we made a gain of 0.03 million on this day with our Alpha, calculated by adding the PnLs of all stocks in our vector.
This is how the simulator calculates the PnL generated by the Alpha for any given date.

Step 6 Perform the operations in Step 1 to Step 5 for each date in a several-year history span also called the In-sample period IS to get daily PnL generated for each day

For each day, the expression is evaluated and the values in the Alpha output vector represent the weights to allocate to each stock.
Alpha weights are not how much you want to buy or sell, but a weighting position you would reach this day.
These weights are multiplied by book size total money invested in the portfolio to get the dollar value held in each stock.
For example, if the Alpha weight after neutralization and scaling for MSFT is 0.2423, then well have MSFT stocks with the total value 0.2423book size.

The weight can be negative, meaning you would take a short position on these stocks.
If the value is positive, you would take a long position on these stocks, i.e.
buy the stocks.
A NAN value would mean no weight is allocated to that instrument i.e.
no money is allocated.
The value of stocks you buysell on a particular day is determined by the difference between weights today and weights yesterday.
The percentage of your portfolio traded in a day by dollar value is called turnover.
The turnover reported in simulation results is the average daily turnover over the simulation.

Step 7 Calculate the cumulative PnL of the Alpha from the start of the in-sample period to get the PnL chart of the Alpha.

Based on those daily positions, PnL is calculated and displayed.
By default, the BRAIN platform will normalize your weights according to the operations you enter and create a portfolio of 20 million total booksize worth of equity.
Note that a portfolio is just a collection of securities.

This can be better understood with the help of the PnL chart of the Alpha in our example rank-returns

In this chart, we have an IS period of five years, from February 2016 to January 2021.
Using the steps from the example, the simulator would calculate the daily PnL of the Alpha and derive the cumulative PnL chart, as we see here.
Note that the two years from February 2021 to January 2023 are not visible to us in the simulation window.
Thats called the out-of-sample, or the OS, period.
After you submit an Alpha, several tests are run to analyze the Alphas performance in the OS period.
An Alpha that passes both the in-sample and out-of-sample tests can be said to be a robust Alpha.

This is how the BRAIN simulator creates the PnL chart from an Alpha.

In our example, weve assumed that were using market neutralization and Decay 0 settings.
But if we used any other neutralization settings, the same operations would be performed on the Alpha.

Say we have 80 stocks in our simulation universe  ten industries with eight stocks each.
The simulator would perform the same operations first Step 1 to Step 5 on each of the ten groups and finally add the PnL from each group to get the daily PnL of the Alpha and create the cumulative PnL chart Step 6 and Step 7

However, if we introduce decay into our Alpha settings, an additional step must be performed to get the final Alpha vector.

Suppose we use a decay of 3 in our simulation settings.
The final vector of weights in the Alpha would be calculated by combining todays value with the previous days decayed value.
In our example, we calculated the normalized weights in the Alpha as of February 2nd.
Lets assume that the normalized weights of stocks in the Alpha vector on February 1st and January 31st are as shown in Columns N and O, respectively.

Then the final weights in the Alpha would be calculated using the given weighted average formula

which is implemented in Column P.
Using this new derived vector, the simulator would calculate the daily PnL and consequently the cumulative PnL chart.
Note that even if decay is used, more weight is assigned to the most recent values.
So decay is an important factor in reducing transaction costs or turnover, as it includes information from previous days, preventing the Alpha from being reactive.

To summarize, once we input the Alpha expression and simulation settings in the BRAIN simulator, it performs the operations discussed above to take long or short positions for each financial instrument and generates the PnL chart.

The below post illustrates in detail how the BRAIN platform works and what happens in the background when you simulate an Alpha.
Even though youll never need to do these calculations yourselves, developing an intuition for them will help you in the Alpha making process.

Imagine market data being a matrix, with each row representing one date and each column representing one stock.
For example, the matrix for close price data of stocks in universe US TOP3000 would look like this

When you input the simulation settings and click Simulate, the BRAIN platform will evaluate the Alpha expression against the matrix of market data for each date in a five year span, taking a long or short position for each financial instrument to generate the PnL chart.

Behind the scenes, seven steps, or operations, are performed before the final PnL chart is generated.

Normally, in an Alpha simulation, there would be between 200 and 3,000 stock instruments in the universe.
But to better understand this concept, well assume a hypothetical scenario in which the simulation universe has only eight stocks.
We simulate the expression rank-returns with market neutralization, Delay 1 and Decay 0 settings for now.

The hypothesis in this expression is that we want to buy, or go long on, those stocks tomorrow that had negative or comparatively lower returns today, and we want to sell, or go short on, those stocks tomorrow that had positive or comparatively higher returns today.

Weve used the rank operator, which ranks the input values inside the operator and return values equally distributed between zero and 1.
This is an example of a reversion idea.

In Column B, we have the eight stocks in the Alpha vector.
Column C shows the returns of these stocks as of February 1st.
These serve as the input data of the Alpha expression.

Step1 Evaluate the expression for each stock to generate the Alpha vector for the given date.

In our case, this date would be February 2nd, because weve assumed Delay 1 settings.
The Delay 1 setting uses data as of T-1 date to create the Alpha vector as of T date.

To produce the Alpha vector, the simulator performs the rank operation on negative returns and produces a vector of values corresponding to each stock.

The resulting vector depends on the operators used in the Alpha expression.
In our case, since weve used the rank operator, we see equally distributed values between 0 and 1 in Column D.
Note that the stock with the lowest return has the highest value, and vice versa, in line with our hypothesis.

Step 2 From each value in the vector, subtract the average of the vector values in the group.
Sum of all vector values  0.
This is called neutralization.

The group can be the entire market, but we can also perform this neutralization operation on sector, industry or subindustry groupings of stocks.

Since we have only eight stocks in our simulation universe, weve assumed to neutralize the stocks over the market.

So we take the average of the numbers in Cell D12 and subtract the average from each stock.
This gives us a new vector in Column F.
Note that both the sum and the average of these new numbers are now zero.
Also, the sum of positive values is equal to the sum of negative values.

Step 3 The resulting values are scaled or normalized such that absolute sum of the Alpha vector values is 1.
These values can be called as normalized weights.

That means, we sum the absolute values of each row and find the sum, which is 2.3.
Then we divide each row by this sum, which results in normalized values.
By normalize, we mean that the total absolute sum of Column H is 1.
We can also call this vector a normalized vector of weights.

Note On each iterationday, the expression rank-returns will have access to all the data for returns up to that day, and the matrix will grow by one line every day until it reaches the most recent date.
The role of the expression is to transform the input matrix to an output vector of weights as we see in this hypothetical example.

Step 4 Using normalized weights, the BRAIN simulator allocates capital from a fictitious book of 20 million to each stock to construct a portfolio.

Column J has a total of 20 million of fictional money allocated to the stocks, using the normalized weights in Column H.
This means we have a position of minus 4.4 million in Stock 1  that is, weve shorted 4.4 million worth of Stock 1  and a long position of 0.6 million in Stock 5.
That is, weve invested 0.6 million in Stock 5.

This is called long-short market neutralization, and its the backbone of creating these predictive models, or Alphas, on BRAIN.
With this technique, a strategy can have the potential to be profitable regardless of the direction of the market.

Step 5 Calculate next day PnL generated by the Alpha based on observed stock returns the next day

That is, after allocating dollar positions on the stocks, we calculate the PnL generated by each stock, based on the returns each stock had that day.

Suppose the actual returns on these stocks as of February 2nd are as shown in Column K.
We see that although we expected Stock 1 and Stock 2 to fall in price, they actually went up, so we had a loss, shown in Column L.

We expected Stock 6 to go up in price, but it stayed flat.
So we were wrong about three stocks, but we were right about five.
In total, we made a gain of 0.03 million on this day with our Alpha, calculated by adding the PnLs of all stocks in our vector.
This is how the simulator calculates the PnL generated by the Alpha for any given date.

Step 6 Perform the operations in Step 1 to Step 5 for each date in a several-year history span also called the In-sample period IS to get daily PnL generated for each day

For each day, the expression is evaluated and the values in the Alpha output vector represent the weights to allocate to each stock.
Alpha weights are not how much you want to buy or sell, but a weighting position you would reach this day.
These weights are multiplied by book size total money invested in the portfolio to get the dollar value held in each stock.
For example, if the Alpha weight after neutralization and scaling for MSFT is 0.2423, then well have MSFT stocks with the total value 0.2423book size.

The weight can be negative, meaning you would take a short position on these stocks.
If the value is positive, you would take a long position on these stocks, i.e.
buy the stocks.
A NAN value would mean no weight is allocated to that instrument i.e.
no money is allocated.
The value of stocks you buysell on a particular day is determined by the difference between weights today and weights yesterday.
The percentage of your portfolio traded in a day by dollar value is called turnover.
The turnover reported in simulation results is the average daily turnover over the simulation.

Step 7 Calculate the cumulative PnL of the Alpha from the start of the in-sample period to get the PnL chart of the Alpha.

Based on those daily positions, PnL is calculated and displayed.
By default, the BRAIN platform will normalize your weights according to the operations you enter and create a portfolio of 20 million total booksize worth of equity.
Note that a portfolio is just a collection of securities.

This can be better understood with the help of the PnL chart of the Alpha in our example rank-returns

In this chart, we have an IS period of five years, from February 2016 to January 2021.
Using the steps from the example, the simulator would calculate the daily PnL of the Alpha and derive the cumulative PnL chart, as we see here.
Note that the two years from February 2021 to January 2023 are not visible to us in the simulation window.
Thats called the out-of-sample, or the OS, period.
After you submit an Alpha, several tests are run to analyze the Alphas performance in the OS period.
An Alpha that passes both the in-sample and out-of-sample tests can be said to be a robust Alpha.

This is how the BRAIN simulator creates the PnL chart from an Alpha.

In our example, weve assumed that were using market neutralization and Decay 0 settings.
But if we used any other neutralization settings, the same operations would be performed on the Alpha.

Say we have 80 stocks in our simulation universe  ten industries with eight stocks each.
The simulator would perform the same operations first Step 1 to Step 5 on each of the ten groups and finally add the PnL from each group to get the daily PnL of the Alpha and create the cumulative PnL chart Step 6 and Step 7

However, if we introduce decay into our Alpha settings, an additional step must be performed to get the final Alpha vector.

Suppose we use a decay of 3 in our simulation settings.
The final vector of weights in the Alpha would be calculated by combining todays value with the previous days decayed value.
In our example, we calculated the normalized weights in the Alpha as of February 2nd.
Lets assume that the normalized weights of stocks in the Alpha vector on February 1st and January 31st are as shown in Columns N and O, respectively.

Then the final weights in the Alpha would be calculated using the given weighted average formula

which is implemented in Column P.
Using this new derived vector, the simulator would calculate the daily PnL and consequently the cumulative PnL chart.
Note that even if decay is used, more weight is assigned to the most recent values.
So decay is an important factor in reducing transaction costs or turnover, as it includes information from previous days, preventing the Alpha from being reactive.

To summarize, once we input the Alpha expression and simulation settings in the BRAIN simulator, it performs the operations discussed above to take long or short positions for each financial instrument and generates the PnL chart.

###### Simulation Settings


###### Simulation Settings

The settings panel can be found by clicking the Settings button at the top right hand corner of the Simulate page.
You can specify parameters like language, instrument type, universe, delay, neutralization, etc., which will be applied to your next simulation after clicking the Apply button.

Fast Expression is available on BRAIN.
To learn more, refer to Available Operators

Only Equity instrument type can be used at the moment

The only region currently available to all BRAIN users is the US market.
The regions Europe and Asia are currently available only to our research consultants.

Universe is a set of trading instruments prepared by BRAIN.
For example, US TOP3000 represents the top 3000 most liquid stocks in the US market determined by highest average daily dollar volume traded.

Delay refers to the availability of data, relative to decision time.
In other words, delay is the assumption of when we can trade stock once we decide on a position.

Assume that you are looking at the data today before market close and you decide that you want to buy stock.
We can choose an aggressive approach and trade stock in the time left till market close.
In this case, the position is based on data available on the same day today.
This is called Delay 0 simulation.

Alternatively, we could choose a conservative trading strategy and trade stock the next daytomorrow.
Then the position is achieved tomorrow and it is based on todays data.
In this case, there is a lag of 1 day.
This is called Delay 1 simulation.
In expression language, delay is applied automatically and you do not have to bother about it.

This performs a linear decay function over the past n days by combining todays value with previous days decayed value.
It performs the following function

Legal values for Decay Integer n where n  0.
NOTE Using negative or non-integer values for Decay will break simulations.

Tip Decay can be used to reduce turnover, but decay values that are too large will attenuate the signal.

The maximum weight for each stock in the overall portfolio.
When it is set to 0, there is no restriction.

Legal values for Truncation Float x where 0  x  1 NOTE Any values for Truncation outside this range can impactbreak simulations.

Tip Truncation aims to guard from being too exposed to movements in individual stocks.
The recommended setting is between 0.05 and 0.1 entailing 5-10.

Neutralization is an operation used to make our strategy marketindustrysub-industry neutral.
When Neutralization  Market it does the following operation

Alpha  Alpha  meanAlpha

where Alpha is the vector of weights.

Basically, it makes the mean of the Alpha vector zero.
Thus no net position is taken with respect to the market.
In other words, the long exposure cancels out the short exposure completely, making our strategy market neutral.

When Neutralization  Industry or Subindustry, all the instruments in the Alpha vector are grouped into smaller buckets corresponding to industry or sub-industry and neutralization is applied separately to each of the buckets.
For illustration of industrysubindustry classification, see GICS note this is not necessarily the same classification standard used by BRAIN platform.

To learn more about Neutralization, refer the Neutralization FAQ section.

Pasteurization replaces input values with NaN pasteurizes for instruments not in the Alpha universe.
When Pasteurize  On, inputs to will be converted to NaN for instruments not in the universe selected in Simulation Settings.
When Pasteurize  Off, this operation does not happen and all available inputs are used.

Pasteurized data has non-NaN values only for instruments in the Alpha universe.
While pasteurized data contains less information, it may be more appropriate when considering cross-sectional or group operations.
The default Pasteurize setting is On.
Researchers can switch it to Off and use pasteurizex operator for manual pasteurization.

Example

Assume the following settings are used Universe TOP500, Pasteurize Off.
The following code calculates the difference between sector rank of sales_growth in Alpha universe and sector rank of sales_growth among all instruments

The pasteurize operator in the first group_rank pasteurizes input to the Alpha universe TOP500, while the second group_rank ranks sales_growth among all instruments.

NaNHandling replaces NaN values with other values.
If NaNHandling On, NaN values are handled based on operator type.
For time series operators, if all inputs are NaN, 0 is returned.
For group operators returning one value per group e.g.
groupmedian, groupcount, if the input value for an instrument is NaN, the value for the group is returned.

If NaNHandling  Off, NaNs are preserved.
For time series operators, if all inputs are NaN, NaN is returned.
For group operators, if the input value for an instrument is NaN, NaN is returned.
Researchers should handle NaNs manually in this case.
The default setting NaNHandling value is Off.
Some ways to manually handle NaN values can replicate On behavior.

Example

Assume NaNHandling  On.
Then for a stock with etz_eps  NaN for all 252 days, 0 is returned.
However, ts_zscorex, d also returns 0 when x  tsmeanx, d, which is different from x  NaN no data is available.
This means that NaNHandling  On increases coverage, but may introduce ambiguous information into the Alpha.

If NaNHandling  Off, NaNs can be handled other ways

is_nants_zscoreetz_eps, 252 ?
ts_zscoreest_eps, 252  ts_zscoreetz_eps, 252

Here, est_eps is used when etz_eps has NaN value for all 252 days.

Example

When NaNHandling  Off and sales is NaN for a given instrument, the operators output is NaN.
When NaNHandling  On and sales is NaN for a given instrument, the operators output is the maximum value of sales in the instruments industry.

Unit Handling option allows raising a warning when incompatible units are used in an operator.
This warning appears if expression uses data fields that are incompatible, for example, a warning will be shown for an attempt to add price to volume.

The Test Period is a feature designed to enhance your Alpha and SuperAlpha testing process.
This tool allows you to set a separate test period from your IS period, providing a more flexible approach to testing your research ideas.

Using the Feature

The Test Period feature is designed to help you avoid overfitting.
It allows you to divide your In-Sample IS period into a Train and Test period.
The Train period can be utilized to develop your Alphas and SuperAlphas, while the Test period is ideal for validating them.
An Alpha or SuperAlpha that is developed based on the simulation results of Training Period and performs well in both periods is likely a strong candidate for submission and may have avoided overfitting.

While choosing a Test period does not directly affect the simulation, it influences the statistics and the visualization.
The submission tests will run on the entire 5-year period, with the simulation running on the entire 5-year IS.
However, if a testing period is chosen, the simulation stats will be divided into two sections one covering the training period and another for the test period.

###### Simulation Settings

Alphas are created and simulated on the Simulate page in the Alphas dropdown tab.
To run your first simulation, click on the gear icon at the top right-hand side corner.
This will open the settings panel.
Here, select US TOP3000 for Region and Universe, Subindustry for Neutralization and apply your settings.
Make sure both Code and Result are ticked by clicking on them.
In the Alpha expression text box, enter -Deltaclose, 5 for now and click on Simulate.
The Simulation Result page will show a graph for Cumulative Profit.
This graph can be zoomed in to plot area for shorter time periods 1 month or 1 year.

The display consists of 2 graphs, one for PnL vs.
Time and the other for Sharpe Ratio vs.
Time.

In the Stats tab, a good Alpha tend to have consistently increasing PnL and high Annual Return, Sharpe Ratio,  Profitable Days and Profit per Dollar Traded.
It should have low Drawdown and Turnover.
And more importantly, it shouldnt have high fluctuations in the cumulative profit graph.
If the standard deviation is low, there tends to be lesser fluctuations in the graph.
If the graph shows high fluctuationsvolatility, despite the returns being high, the Alpha will not be deemed good enough.
An Alpha is considered to be good if

The graph above for Alpha expression -Deltaclose, 5 shows several significant drawdowns, as well as a flattening of returns in 2017.
The table below marks this Alpha as Inferior Needs Improvement.
PnL and Sharpe for 2017 drop low, and drawdown is large in 2014 and 2015.
This Alpha is Inferior Needs Improvement due to high volatility and low returns.

Use the green refreshing button in the Correlation block to get the information about the correlation of the currently simulated Alpha with the Alphas in your own OS Out-of-Sample pool.
This will be explained further in the Simulation Results page.

The image below shows the Properties of the Alpha.
You can name your Alpha, assign a category and color code, and add user-defined tags to them.
You can add a brief description about your Alpha for your reference.
Suggestion - keep the number of user-defined tags low so that they dont proliferate and are easily searchable in the My Alphas page.

To Submit Alpha for OS Test, click the Submit Alpha button in the Submission tab of the results panel.
This will check if the Alpha meets the Correlation and Sharpe criteria before submitting it.

Time and the other for Sharpe Ratio vs.
Time.

In the Stats tab, a good Alpha tend to have consistently increasing PnL and high Annual Return, Sharpe Ratio,  Profitable Days and Profit per Dollar Traded.
It should have low Drawdown and Turnover.
And more importantly, it shouldnt have high fluctuations in the cumulative profit graph.
If the standard deviation is low, there tends to be lesser fluctuations in the graph.
If the graph shows high fluctuationsvolatility, despite the returns being high, the Alpha will not be deemed good enough.
An Alpha is considered to be good if

The graph above for Alpha expression -Deltaclose, 5 shows several significant drawdowns, as well as a flattening of returns in 2017.
The table below marks this Alpha as Inferior Needs Improvement.
PnL and Sharpe for 2017 drop low, and drawdown is large in 2014 and 2015.
This Alpha is Inferior Needs Improvement due to high volatility and low returns.

Use the green refreshing button in the Correlation block to get the information about the correlation of the currently simulated Alpha with the Alphas in your own OS Out-of-Sample pool.
This will be explained further in the Simulation Results page.

The image below shows the Properties of the Alpha.
You can name your Alpha, assign a category and color code, and add user-defined tags to them.
You can add a brief description about your Alpha for your reference.
Suggestion - keep the number of user-defined tags low so that they dont proliferate and are easily searchable in the My Alphas page.

To Submit Alpha for OS Test, click the Submit Alpha button in the Submission tab of the results panel.
This will check if the Alpha meets the Correlation and Sharpe criteria before submitting it.

Below table is for submission test for Alphas

Alphas are also tested on the distribution of Alpha weights across stocks.
Alphas can fail this test if

Sub-universe test is one of the robustness tests performed on an Alpha by the BRAIN platform before submission.
In simple words, it ensures that your Alpha works not only in the universe you are trying to submit, but that it would also work in the next more liquid or smaller universe to some extent.

E.
g.
if you are trying to submit an Alpha on USA TOP3000, the platform will also check its performance on USA TOP1000.
If it performs poorly, then it means that your Alpha is generating most of the profit on the non-liquid portion of stocks, which is one of the signs that your Alpha is not robust enough and most likely will not perform as well as expected in out-of-sample testing.
Thats why such Alphas are not allowed to be submitted on Brain.

In the Simulation result page, you will find a ratings panel in the Stats tab of Results that says Spectacular, Excellent, Good, Average or Needs Improvement depending on your Alphas Fitness as shown below

Return is the gain or loss of a security or portfolio in a particular period.
Return consists of the income received plus capital gains, relative to the amount of the investment.
In BRAIN, return  annualized PnL  half of book size.

Information ratio IR measures the prediction ability of a model.
In BRAIN, it is defined as the ratio of a portfolios mean daily returns to the volatility of those returns

where PnL is the daily profit and loss, in dollars.

Sharpe is the annualized version of the IR statistic, i.e.
Sharpe  sqrt 252IR  15.8IR where 252 is the average number of trading days days the markets are open in the USA in a year.

Sharpe or IR measures the returns of an Alpha while attempting to identify its consistency.
The higher the IR, the more consistent the Alphas returns are, and consistency is an ideal trait.
High Sharpe or IR is more desirable than just high return.

Note Sharpe and IR may be defined somewhat differently elsewhere than in BRAIN.

Fitness of an Alpha is a function of Returns, Turnover and Sharpe

Good Alphas have high fitness.
You can optimize the performance of your Alphas by increasing Sharpe or returns and reducing turnover.
Improving one factor normally has an adverse impact on the other factor.
As you work on optimizing your Alpha, an improvement in its fitness is an indication that your changes are having a positive impact.

Cumulative PnL Chart A graph shown below of an Alphas performance PnL over entire simulation.
This graph can be zoomed in by clicking and dragging below the plot area.
Start and end dates for PnL plotting can also be changed here.
Clicking the Sharpe Ratio in dropdown menu at the upper right from PnL graph displays the Sharpe ratio graph Sharpe over time.
Make sure that the PnL graph has an upward trend, the Sharpe is high and the Drawdown is kept to a minimum.

IS Summary Scrolling down to the Stats block shown below of the simulation results shows various metrics about the Alphas performance.

Year The year on which the data was simulated.
The last row shows the Alphas performance over all years.

LongShort Count The number of instruments in long or short positions, respectively.

Sharpe Sharpe  IR  Sqrt252, where IR  AvgPnLStd_devPnL over the observed time period.

Fitness is defined in the Alpha Performance help page Fitness  Sharpe  sqrtabsReturns  maxTurnover, 0.125.

Returns The return on capital traded Annual Return  Annualized PnL  Half of Book Size.
It signifies the amount you made or lost during the period observed and is expressed in .
Book size refers to the amount of capital money used to trade during the simulation.
Book size is constant and is set to 20 million every day throughout the simulation.
Profit is not reinvested, and losses are replaced by cash injection into the portfolio.
BRAIN assumes you have 10 million and will invest in assets up to 20 million.
This is called leverage.
Performance like Returns, Sharpe is computed on a base of 10 million.

Turnover Turnover signifies how often one trades.
It can be defined as the ratio of value traded to book size.
Daily Turnover  Dollar trading volumeBook size.
Good Alphas have low turnover, since low turnover means lower transaction costs.

Margin The profit per dollar traded calculated as PnL divided by total dollars traded for a given time period.

PnL Profit and Loss PnL is the money that the positions and trades generate which means it is the amount of money you lost or made during the year, expressed in dollars.

daily_PnL  sum of size of position  daily_return for all instruments, where the daily return per instrument  todays close  yesterdays close  1.0.

Drawdown - the largest reduction in PnL during a time period, expressed as a percentage.
It is calculated as follows find the largest peak to trough drawdown in PnL, and divide its dollar amount by half of book size 1

Generate Self Correlation Clicking the Down Arrow button in a Self Correlation row will produce a table with the performance statistics of up to the 5 most correlated Alphas you submitted that qualified for OS testing.
This information is meant to help the user ensure they have a diverse set of Alphas.
This information can also be accessed by clicking on the Alpha in the Alphas page.

The rolling 5-year In-Sample simulation period begins seven years ago and ends two years ago, updating daily.
Using simulation settings, you can divide your In-Sample IS period into a Train and Test period.
The Train period can be utilized to develop your Alphas and SuperAlphas, while the Test period is ideal for validating them.
An Alpha developed based on the simulation results of training period and performs well in both periods is likely a strong candidate for submission and may have avoided overfitting.

The latest two years of data, the Semi-OS, are hidden for scoring and testing purposes.
Consultants have access to a 10-year In-sample period, instead of 5-year.

Keeping the last 2 years of data hidden leads to higher confidence in the Out-Sample OS performance of Alphas and their scores.
Statistics shown in the OS Tab of My Alphas page will be populated as data becomes available by each passing day.

A named collection of data, which has constant type and business meaning.
For example, open price is of constant type numeric, and it consistently means the price of a security at the starting time of the trading period.
Close price has the same type as open price, but its a different field as it differs in business meaning.

A Dataset is a collection of Data Fields.
Dataset can be identified by its name text format, longer and explanatory or its dataset ID short alphanumeric format, only relevant for advanced scripting.

Basic type of field which has just one value of every date and instrument.
There is no special syntax for using this in simulation.
Some examples of matrix fields are close, returns, cap.

Type of field which has more than one value for every date and instrument.
Vector data fields have to be converted into matrix data fields using vector operators before using with other operators and matrix data fields.
Otherwise, an error message will be returned.

You can learn more about it here Vector data fields

A source of information on one or more variables of interest for the WorldQuant investment process.
A collection of data fields.
For example price volume data for US equities or analyst target price predictions for US equities.
See Datasets.

WorldQuant BRAIN has thousands of data fields for you to create Alphas.
But how do you quickly understand a new data field?
Here are 6 ways.
Simulate the below expressions in None neutralization and decay 0 setting.
And obtains insights of specific parameters using the Long Count and Short Count in the IS Summary section of the results.

For example, if you simulate close  0, You will see Long and Short Counts as 0.
This implies that closing price always has a positive value as expected!

Dataset Value Score is a measure which signifies underutilization of a dataset.
Consultants are advised to research and make Alphas using datasets with a higher value score.
Dont confuse this with Value Factor.

Coverage refers to the fraction of the total instruments present in the universe for which the given data field has a defined value.
Low coverage fields can be handled by making use of backfill operators like ts_backfill, kth element, group_backfill, etc.
Make use of the visualization feature to analyze the coverage of the data fields.
Read this BRAIN Forum Post to know more about coverage handling.

## Table of Contents

Powered by advanced AI technologies, such as NLP, the Data Explorer helps you quickly and accurately identify the data fields to implement your idea.

Lets say you have an Alpha idea using market sentiment.
You can easily search for related datasets and data fields in the Data Explorer.
Notice that you will have to pre-define region, delay and universe prior to your search.
Some data fields are present only in certain regions and delays.

You can filter data fields based on criteria such as coverage, type, count of Alphas and users.
For example, you can search for high coverage data fields from Company Fundamental Data for Equity dataset in CHN region and were used in at least 5 submitted Alphas.
You can later sort these data fields by Alpha count to see which fields are used less, i.e., less crowded.

While you can click on the browse by category button, you can also search for datasets using dataset category or dataset name.
This is helpful because it also allows you to filter these datasets by coverage, value score and crowdedness measured by Alpha and user count.
For example, you can search for datasets related to fundamental that have more than 100 active users.
Note that you have to go to the Datasets tab to see the results.

Try to follow the 3Ss rule keep your searches short, simple and straightforward.
Try to use terminologies within your searches to increase the chance of finding the data fields you are looking for.
In case you arent sure of the correct terminology, first try explaining it using your own words.
For example, if you are looking for insider trading data but havent quite found the phrase, try, trade by people inside company and you can achieve the results.

For some well-known concepts, try searching for the abbreviations along with the full name.
This simple practice will not only increase your chances of finding the data fields that you are looking for but you can also obtain additional options to choose from.
For example, try searching for both earnings per share and eps, both implied volatility and IV, etc.

The flowchart below is a suggested research framework with the inclusion of Data Explorer.
You can use it as a reference for creating one for yourself.

There are many methods to determine whether to long buy a stock or to short it.
Quantitative analysis QA in finance is an approach that emphasizes mathematical and statistical analysis to help determine the value of a stock.
Quantitative trading analysts also known as quants use a variety of dataincluding historical investment and stock market datato develop trading algorithms and computer models.
The information generated by these computer models helps investors analyze investment opportunities and develop what they believe will be a successful trading strategy 5.

About the BRAIN Platform

Utilizing the quantitative analysis approach, the BRAIN platform is a web-based simulator of global financial markets that was created to explore Alpha research.
It accepts an Alpha expression as input and plots its Profit and Loss PnL as output.

The input expression is evaluated for each financial instrument, every day over historical dates, and a portfolio is constructed accordingly.
BRAIN platform invests in each financial instrument according to the value of the expression.
It takes positions either buying or short selling and assigns weights to each instrument.

What is an Alpha?

An Alpha is an algorithm that transforms the input data price-volume, news, fundamental, etc.
into a vector in which values are proportional to the positions and weights we want to hold in each instrument for each day.

Weights

Imagine market data being a matrix, with each row representing one date and each column representing one stock.
For example, thematrix for close price datacould look like this

Table Closing stock prices of company A, B and C for 3 respective days.

The role of the Alpha expression is to transform the input matrix to an output vector of weights, with each weight corresponding to one of the stocks.
TheAlpha output vector, having weights as values corresponding to each instrument in the Universe, could look something like this

Table Output vector to indicate the direction as well as sizing for company A, B and C.

Cumulative Profit  Loss PnL

Once we have got the weights of the stock from the Alpha expression, the next step is to get each days profit and loss PnL.

From the above table, I have weight_A  0.2, weight_B  -0.5 and weight_C  0.3.
Now the amount of money I have got to invest is called the booksize.
Suppose my booksize is 100 USD.
So I calculate the money I want to invest in each of the stocks

money_A  0.2  100 USD  20 USD Long

money_B  -0.5  100 USD  50 USD Short

money_C  0.3  100 USD  30 USD Long

Now, I buy 20 USD worth of A, sell 50 USD worth of B and buy 30 USD worth of C.
Now I have a portfolio, which is worth a total of 100 USD.

I keep this portfolio for one full day, and sell it the next day in the simulation period.
Now in one day, the prices of stocks A, B, C have changed.
So the total value of my portfolio has also changed, say from 100 USD to 105 USD.
So, I have made a profit of 5 USD on that day.

Now I again calculate the Alpha values for the stocks, and again calculate weights, and again trade 100 USD worth of portfolio.
Note In BRAIN platform, we use constant book size for all the days, regardless of whether your portfolio makes money or loses money.

This is repeated for each day in the simulation period to calculate and plot the cumulative PnL.

Reducing Risk and Volatility

A good Alpha would ideally have consistently increasing PnL, high Annual Return, and more importantly, few fluctuations in the cumulative profit graph.
If the standard deviation is low, there would be lesser fluctuations in the graph.
If the graph shows high fluctuationsvolatility, despite the returns being high, the Alpha will not be deemed good enough.

WorldQuant aims to develop equity long-short market neutral alphas that have low volatility and risk.
Such investments are attractive because they are expected to produce substantially better risk-adjusted returns than long-only portfolios.
Equity long-short market neutral strategy is used commonly by hedge funds, with the goal of minimizing exposure to the market and profit from the changes in the spread between two stocks.

The information generated by these computer models helps investors analyze investment opportunities and develop what they believe will be a successful trading strategy 5.

About the BRAIN Platform

Utilizing the quantitative analysis approach, the BRAIN platform is a web-based simulator of global financial markets that was created to explore Alpha research.
It accepts an Alpha expression as input and plots its Profit and Loss PnL as output.

The input expression is evaluated for each financial instrument, every day over historical dates, and a portfolio is constructed accordingly.
BRAIN platform invests in each financial instrument according to the value of the expression.
It takes positions either buying or short selling and assigns weights to each instrument.

What is an Alpha?

An Alpha is an algorithm that transforms the input data price-volume, news, fundamental, etc.
into a vector in which values are proportional to the positions and weights we want to hold in each instrument for each day.

Weights

Imagine market data being a matrix, with each row representing one date and each column representing one stock.
For example, thematrix for close price datacould look like this

Table Closing stock prices of company A, B and C for 3 respective days.

The role of the Alpha expression is to transform the input matrix to an output vector of weights, with each weight corresponding to one of the stocks.
TheAlpha output vector, having weights as values corresponding to each instrument in the Universe, could look something like this

Table Output vector to indicate the direction as well as sizing for company A, B and C.

Cumulative Profit  Loss PnL

Once we have got the weights of the stock from the Alpha expression, the next step is to get each days profit and loss PnL.

From the above table, I have weight_A  0.2, weight_B  -0.5 and weight_C  0.3.
Now the amount of money I have got to invest is called the booksize.
Suppose my booksize is 100 USD.
So I calculate the money I want to invest in each of the stocks

money_A  0.2  100 USD  20 USD Long

money_B  -0.5  100 USD  50 USD Short

money_C  0.3  100 USD  30 USD Long

Now, I buy 20 USD worth of A, sell 50 USD worth of B and buy 30 USD worth of C.
Now I have a portfolio, which is worth a total of 100 USD.

I keep this portfolio for one full day, and sell it the next day in the simulation period.
Now in one day, the prices of stocks A, B, C have changed.
So the total value of my portfolio has also changed, say from 100 USD to 105 USD.
So, I have made a profit of 5 USD on that day.

Now I again calculate the Alpha values for the stocks, and again calculate weights, and again trade 100 USD worth of portfolio.
Note In BRAIN platform, we use constant book size for all the days, regardless of whether your portfolio makes money or loses money.

This is repeated for each day in the simulation period to calculate and plot the cumulative PnL.

Reducing Risk and Volatility

A good Alpha would ideally have consistently increasing PnL, high Annual Return, and more importantly, few fluctuations in the cumulative profit graph.
If the standard deviation is low, there would be lesser fluctuations in the graph.
If the graph shows high fluctuationsvolatility, despite the returns being high, the Alpha will not be deemed good enough.

WorldQuant aims to develop equity long-short market neutral alphas that have low volatility and risk.
Such investments are attractive because they are expected to produce substantially better risk-adjusted returns than long-only portfolios.
Equity long-short market neutral strategy is used commonly by hedge funds, with the goal of minimizing exposure to the market and profit from the changes in the spread between two stocks.

You might ask us, how do you come up with ideas for new alphas?
This section will take you through two alpha ideas utilizing technical analysis and fundamental analysis, and explain the thought process behind them.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume.
Technical analysts believe past trading activity and price changes of a security can be valuable indicators of the securitys future price movements.

Across the industry, there are hundreds of patterns and signals that have been developed by researchers to support technical analysis trading.
These include trend lines, channels, moving averages, and momentum indicators 6.

Volume as an indicator

If a companys stock has high volume, it means that many people are buying and selling the stock.
Suppose our hypothesis is that the company with more shares traded is more desirable than another company with low volume.
We will then allocate more weight to the company with higher volume.

One way to express this idea is through the alpha expression here

volume

Try run it for yourself and see what the results are here

Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental analysis is a method of measuring a securitys intrinsic value by examining related economic and financial factors.
Fundamental analysts study anything that can affect a securitys value, from macroeconomic factors such as the state of the economy and industry conditions to microeconomic factors like the effectiveness of the companys management.

Analysts could compare the companys growth rates to the industry and sector that it operates in, along with the other information provided, to see if the company is valued correctly 7.

Inventory Turnover

Financial ratios are ratios of fundamental data which give insights into the health and investment decisions of the company.
One common financial ratio is the inventory turnover.
It is a type of activity ratio that measures how quickly a company sells through and replaces its inventory.
It is calculated as

Sales divided by average inventory.

Typically, higher inventory levels are associated with higher storage costs, insurance and deterioration.
Thehypothesis is thata stock with higher inventory turnover ratio will have poorer stock performance and thus be allocated negative weight.

The alpha expression is as such

-inventory_turnover

Try run it for yourself and see what the results arehere

Time Series  Cross Sectional

Additionally, there are two frequently used operator categories time series and cross sectional.

Time series analysis can be useful to see how a given variable changes over time.
Suppose you wanted to analyze a time series of daily closing stock prices for a given stock over a period of one year.
You could obtain a list of all the closing prices for the stock from each day for the past year and analyze the time series data with technical analysis tools to know whether the stocks time series shows any seasonality.
This will help you to determine if the stock goes through peaks and troughs at regular times each year 8.

Alternatively, you can use cross-sectional analysis, where you compare a particular company to its industry peers.
Cross-sectional analysis may focus on a single company for head-to-head analysis with its biggest competitors or it may approach it from an industry-wide lens to identify companies with a particular strength.
Essentially, cross-sectional analysis shows an investor which company is best given the metrics you care about 9.

We hope youve enjoyed this guide!
To get started, you may click on the Example Button bottom left corner on theSimulate Page.
There you will find some sample alphas with hints to improve it.

If you have any research related questions, you can check out ourCommunity forumand post your questions there.

Inventory Turnover

Financial ratios are ratios of fundamental data which give insights into the health and investment decisions of the company.
One common financial ratio is the inventory turnover.
It is a type of activity ratio that measures how quickly a company sells through and replaces its inventory.
It is calculated as

Sales divided by average inventory.

Typically, higher inventory levels are associated with higher storage costs, insurance and deterioration.
Thehypothesis is thata stock with higher inventory turnover ratio will have poorer stock performance and thus be allocated negative weight.

The alpha expression is as such

-inventory_turnover

Try run it for yourself and see what the results arehere

Time Series  Cross Sectional

Additionally, there are two frequently used operator categories time series and cross sectional.

Time series analysis can be useful to see how a given variable changes over time.
Suppose you wanted to analyze a time series of daily closing stock prices for a given stock over a period of one year.
You could obtain a list of all the closing prices for the stock from each day for the past year and analyze the time series data with technical analysis tools to know whether the stocks time series shows any seasonality.
This will help you to determine if the stock goes through peaks and troughs at regular times each year 8.

Alternatively, you can use cross-sectional analysis, where you compare a particular company to its industry peers.
Cross-sectional analysis may focus on a single company for head-to-head analysis with its biggest competitors or it may approach it from an industry-wide lens to identify companies with a particular strength.
Essentially, cross-sectional analysis shows an investor which company is best given the metrics you care about 9.

thanks for noticing.

Why does a stock with higher inventory turnover ratio have poorer stock performance?
Isnt a higher inventory turnover ratio more desirable as it indicates high liquidity?

You might ask us, how do you come up with ideas for new alphas?
This section will take you through two alpha ideas utilizing technical analysis and fundamental analysis, and explain the thought process behind them.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume.
Technical analysts believe past trading activity and price changes of a security can be valuable indicators of the securitys future price movements.

Across the industry, there are hundreds of patterns and signals that have been developed by researchers to support technical analysis trading.
These include trend lines, channels, moving averages, and momentum indicators 6.

Volume as an indicator

If a companys stock has high volume, it means that many people are buying and selling the stock.
Suppose our hypothesis is that the company with more shares traded is more desirable than another company with low volume.
We will then allocate more weight to the company with higher volume.

One way to express this idea is through the alpha expression here

volume

Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental analysis is a method of measuring a securitys intrinsic value by examining related economic and financial factors.
Fundamental analysts study anything that can affect a securitys value, from macroeconomic factors such as the state of the economy and industry conditions to microeconomic factors like the effectiveness of the companys management.

Analysts could compare the companys growth rates to the industry and sector that it operates in, along with the other information provided, to see if the company is valued correctly 7.

The WorldQuant Challenge is a perpetual, online, solo competition.
Users can submit Alphas to improve their scores and ranking.

Individuals who score 10,000 points may be eligible to receive an invitation for the research consultant opportunity, subject to other criteria e.g.
if they are residents in countries where the BRAIN consultant program is offered.
Users who make it to Gold and Silver levels will have access to special training sessions and videos through the Events page.

New users are automatically enrolled into the challenge.
The Leaderboard ranks all eligible users and can be filtered by country, university andor city.

Each day, all Alphas submitted by a user accumulated and two factors are calculated

Quantity Factor Larger the number of Alphas you submit during a day.
Larger the factor, higher your score

Quality factor Quality factor is calculated as an average of the quality factor of all Alphas submitted during the day.
Larger the factor, higher your score.
It depends on the following settings and results in the in-sample period

Both factors are then normalized across all the users who submitted at least one Alpha on that particular day.
Your final daily score is then function of normalized Quantity and Quality Factors.
The daily score is capped at 2,000 points.

However I am sure this is only after taking 1 alpha into consideration.My doubt is, will the score for my other 2 alphas be realized today and tomorrow, or will they go into waste?

I think the best strategy is just submit 1 per day

According to the program, each day, I can only earn a maximum of 2000 points, which is equal to 1 alpha, but today I submitted 5 alphas, so I can only earn a maximum of 2000 points.
So in the following days, can I accumulate points because at one time I submitted too many alphas?

Can anyone help me figure out why the two values arent matching?

The WorldQuant Challenge is a perpetual, online, solo competition.
Users can submit Alphas to improve their scores and ranking.

Individuals who score 10,000 points may be eligible to receive an invitation for the research consultant opportunity, subject to other criteria e.g.
if they are residents in countries where the BRAIN consultant program is offered.
Users who make it to Gold and Silver levels will have access to special training sessions and videos through the Events page.

New users are automatically enrolled into the challenge.
The Leaderboard ranks all eligible users and can be filtered by country, university andor city.

Each day, all Alphas submitted by a user accumulated and two factors are calculated

Quantity Factor Larger the number of Alphas you submit during a day.
Larger the factor, higher your score

Quality factor Quality factor is calculated as an average of the quality factor of all Alphas submitted during the day.
Larger the factor, higher your score.
It depends on the following settings and results in the in-sample period

Both factors are then normalized across all the users who submitted at least one Alpha on that particular day.
Your final daily score is then function of normalized Quantity and Quality Factors.
The daily score is capped at 2,000 points.

It aims to guard from being too exposed to movements in individual stocks.
The recommended setting is between 0.05 and 0.1 entailing 5-10.

Ts-Zscore is an operator Ts_Zscorex, n  x-ts_meanx, nts_stdx, n, x - data field, n - number of days.

It is calculated by subtracting the mean input value over the past n days from todays input value, and then dividing by the expressing standard deviation of input value over the past n days.
Watch video 6.5 min long for more details.

Average measure of daily trading activity turnover signifies how often an Alpha simulates trades.
It can be defined as the ratio of value traded to book size.
Daily Turnover  Dollar trading volumeBooksize.
Good Alphas tend to have lower turnover, since low turnover means lower transaction costs.
See Simulation results page for details on Alpha simulation results details.

Universe, within the BRAIN platform, is a set of trading instruments provided by the BRAIN platform.
For example, US TOP3000 represents the top 3000 most liquid stocks in the US market.
Please see FAQ for more details.

Value Factor captures the effect of recent Alpha submissions on the performance of a combination of your Alphas taking into account three particular elements a the Alphas individual performance, b the diversity of recent Alpha submissions, and c the uniqueness of submissions as compared to your past submissions and those of other consultants.

Please note that value factor is related to payments for consultants while Dataset Value Score is related to the under-utilization of data.

Value Score is a measure which signifies underutilization of a dataset.
Consultants are advised to research and make Alphas using datasets with a higher value score.
Dont confuse this with Value Factor.

Type of field which has more than one value for every date and instrument.
Different type of reduce operators needs to be used to convert them into matrix fields.

Can have any number of values on one day for one security.
Number of values can vary across days.
Three dimensional structure.
E.g.
Only 3 sentiment values on 1 Jan, but 1 value on 2 Jan

Calculates additional, advanced metrics about Alpha performance increases simulation time.

Volume signifies how many trades have taken place for that stock.
You could google Use of volume in stock market predictions to understand how you can use it.
There are many technical indicators based on volume that you can model your Alphas around.

The volume-weighted average price VWAP is a trading benchmark calculated from price and volume by adding up the dollars traded for every transaction price multiplied by number of shares traded and dividing that by the total shares traded for the day.

BRAIN platform uses an Alpha to create a vector of weights, with each weight corresponding to one of the stocks in the selected universe.
These weights may or may not be market neutralized, as per your neutralization setting by market, industry, subindustry or none.
This creates a portfolio for each day in the simulation period, which can then be used to calculate that days Profit and Loss PnL.

An Alpha is defined by WorldQuant as a mathematical model that seeks to predict the future price movements of various financial instruments.
See articles on the Alphas page.

Alpha list is a tool to compare your Alphas and check the correlation of those Alphas with each other.
You can add your Alphas to a list using Alpha to list and Alpha lists tools available on the Alphas page and Simulate page in the right upper corner.
The same tool allows comparing PnL graphs of Alphas of the same list.

An Alpha created on a single dataset with relaxed submission checks.

This is the performance you see on the results page when simulating an Alpha.
See Documentation for Alphas page and IS, Semi OS and OS for details.

Instrument is a financial term for any tradeable security stocks, futures, currencies, bonds, ETFs, options, etc..
Please refer to FAQ and Financial Instruments wiki for more details .

Investability Constraints ensure that the positions taken by an Alpha are within the liquidity limits of the instruments.
This helps avoid significant market impact, which can negatively affect the Alphas profitability.
An Alpha that performs well under Investability Constraints will potentially have higher capacity and liquidity.

httpsplatform.worldquantbrain.comlearndocumentationadvanced-topicsgetting-started-investability-constrained-metrics

The IS Ladder test checks if Sharpe over the most recent years are consistently above respective minimum thresholds.
It is one of the statistical significance tests to reduce the possibility of false positive random signals.

Long-short neutral strategy is commonly used by hedge funds globally.
This involves allocating an equal dollar amount to long positions and short positions.
This type of strategy can then profit from a change in the spread between stocks.
You have also minimized exposure to the market in general, i.e.
the ability of this strategy to make a profit is not directly tied to the direction of the market either up or down.
Please watch video 4 min What is an Alpha for more details.

E.g.
Only one open price of Google on 1 Jan

A feature designed to enhance the liquidity and scalability of the Alphas.
It limits the daily position changes of instruments based on a fraction of their 20-day average daily volume adv20.
This ensures that the Alphas adjust positions less frequently in illiquid instruments, which can significantly reduce turnover and improve the Sharpe ratio of the sub-universe.

httpsplatform.worldquantbrain.comlearndocumentationconsultant-informationconsultant-features

Refer to Reversion.

The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers and can be more descriptive of that data set than the average.
Please refer here for details .

In financial markets, momentum refers to the empirical observation that asset prices that have been rising recently are likely to rise further and vice versa.
Within the framework of the efficient market hypothesis, momentum is one of the market anomalies based on return autocorrelations along with reversion, seasonality, momentum reversal that originate from the fact that investors immediate reactions may be improper and tend to adjust over time.

NaN stands for Not a Number.
It is used to indicate results of invalid operations like division by zero or if some data is unavailable.
Please see Documentation for NaN handling in simulation setting and FAQ for details.

Refers to the contribution of Alphas to the strategy.

Neutralization helps to reduce the risk by making strategies long-short market neutral.

On the BRAIN platform, to neutralize an Alpha, the raw Alpha values are split into groups, and then neutralized within each group - the mean is subtracted from each value.
In theory, there are other ways of neutralization as well for example, orthogonalization.

Watch Video 4 min long about long-short market neutral strategy.
Check DocumentationNeutralization and FAQ for details.

Operator is a set of mathematical or statistical techniques required to implement your Alpha ideas.
Read LearnOperators for more details.

It is the real world performance on Alpha.
See Documentation Alphas page and IS, Semi OS and OS for details.

Company stock currently held by all shareholders.
Includes shares held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by the companys officers and insiders.

Overfitting here refers to changing the Alpha expression slightly in a nonsensical way, just to get a good IS Sharpe e.g.
slightly changing the constants in the expression, changing the power of a parameter from 2 to 2.5, static flip sign of some sectors etc.
This shouldnt be done since it will inevitably fail the OS test constraints.
Please watch video 6.5 min long How to Avoid Overfitting and see FAQ Alpha Performance for details.

Pasteurization replaces input values with NaN pasteurizes for instruments not in the Alpha universe.
When Pasteurize  On, inputs will be converted to NaN for instruments not in the universe selected in Simulation Settings.
When Pasteurize  Off, this operation does not happen and all available inputs are used.
Please see Simulation setting for details and FAQ for examples.

Refer to Base payment.

Refers to production status.
Only PROD Alphas, which are created and submitted only by BRAIN consultants, are available for use by WorldQuant in its investment strategies.

This correlation metric is determined by the Mmaximum Pearson correlation coefficient from comparing a given Alpha to all other Alphas submitted by all Brain consultants.

Profit and Loss PnL is the money that the positions and trades generate based on the simulation of an Alpha which means it is the amount of money lost made or made lost during the year, expressed in dollars.

daily_PnL  sum of size of position  daily_return for all instruments, where the daily return per instrument  todays close  yesterdays close  1.0.
See Simulation results page for details on Alpha simulation results.

A combination of region, delay, and dataset category.
E.g.
USA-D1-analyst.
A consultant is considered to formulate a pyramid if they have submitted a minimum of 3 Alphas in it.
A single Alpha can belong to multiple pyramids as it could have multiple data fields.

The weight test simply measures the capital concentration in a single stock of an Alpha.
In BRAIN, the limit is 10 of the total book size.
The weight test is important to limit drawdown risk created by the fluctuation of the stock price, especially in Out-of-Sample.Use lower truncation value in the settings BRAIN provides truncation to control the concentration of the stock weight in the Alpha simulation.
The value 0.1 means the cut off limit is 10 of the book size.Coverage

One of the major factors leading to failing weight test is coverage.
For example, if the number of stocks on the long or short size at any point in the simulation is less than 10, or the total of the stocks is less than 20.
Often Alphas with low-coverage andor unbalanced long-short count fail the weight test.How to handle low coverage

Be creative, you might create a new Alpha with proper filling techniques and there are more to explore than whats listed here.Alpha magnitude distribution

Not all the weight test failures are due to data coverage problems.
Another major factor that may contribute to the failure comes from Alpha ideas that rely heavily on data distribution.
The weight problem appears when the data is widespread, having outliers or errors in the data.
So reduce outliersOften, the weight test setting helps in general with infrequent outliers but there is no guarantee.
Another approach is to change the data distribution using rank or group_rank functions.
Range normalized functions such as rank, log, scale and zscore are helpful here, too.

Rank is designed to balance the long-short count.
Rank makes the data distribution look like uniform distribution.
Make sure you understand and control the range of the data as well.
It is a good practice to normalize data range before working with it.

So reduce outliersOften, the weight test setting helps in general with infrequent outliers but there is no guarantee.
Another approach is to change the data distribution using rank or group_rank functions.
Range normalized functions such as rank, log, scale and zscore are helpful here, too.

Rank is designed to balance the long-short count.
Rank makes the data distribution look like uniform distribution.
Make sure you understand and control the range of the data as well.
It is a good practice to normalize data range before working with it.

The weight test simply measures the capital concentration in a single stock of an Alpha.
In BRAIN, the limit is 10 of the total book size.
The weight test is important to limit drawdown risk created by the fluctuation of the stock price, especially in Out-of-Sample.Use lower truncation value in the settings BRAIN provides truncation to control the concentration of the stock weight in the Alpha simulation.
The value 0.1 means the cut off limit is 10 of the book size.Coverage

One of the major factors leading to failing weight test is coverage.
For example, if the number of stocks on the long or short size at any point in the simulation is less than 10, or the total of the stocks is less than 20.
Often Alphas with low-coverage andor unbalanced long-short count fail the weight test.How to handle low coverage

Be creative, you might create a new Alpha with proper filling techniques and there are more to explore than whats listed here.Alpha magnitude distribution

Not all the weight test failures are due to data coverage problems.

## Didn't find what you were looking for?

WorldQuant BRAIN has thousands of datafields for you to create alphas.
But how do you quickly understand a new datafield?
Here are 6 ways.
Simulate the below expressions in None neutralization and decay 0 setting.
And obtains insights of specific parameters using the Long Count and Short Count in the IS Summary section of the results.

Sr.
No

Long Count indicates average non-zero values on a daily basis

3

ts_std_devdatafield,N !

Frequency of unique data daily, weekly, monthly etc..

Some datasets have data backfilled for missing values, while some do not.
The given expression can be used to find the frequency of unique datafield updates by varying N no.
of days.

Datafields with a quarterly unique data frequency would see a Long Count  Short Count value close to its actual coverage when N  66 quarter.
When N  22 month Long Count  Short Count would be lower approx.
13rd of coverage and when N  5 week, Long Count  Short Count would be even lower.

4

absdatafield  X

Bounds of the datafield.
Vary the values of X and see the Long Count.
For example, X1 will indicate if the field is normalized to values between -1 and 1?

5

ts_mediandatafield, 1000  X

Median of the datafield over 5 years.
Vary the values of X and see the Long Count.
Similar process can be applied to check the mean of the datafield.

6

X  scale_downdatafield  scale_downdatafield  Y

Distribution of the datafield.
scale_down acts as a MinMaxScaler that can preserve the original distribution of the data.
X and Y are values that vary between 0 and 1 that allow us to check how the datafield distribute across its range.

For example, if you simulate close  0, You will see Long and Short Counts as 0.
This implies that closing price always has a positive value as expected!

为什么 datafield !
0 ?
1  0 用这个且设置了中性化会导致 long 和 short 都是 0 呢按理说只是减去平均值难道是因为字段里不存在为 0 的值吗

I am confused by datafield, the alpha can get insight of coverage by

but

1.
i get the datafield fscore_total, its description show its coverage in US-TOP 3000 is 30

2.
i run a simulation, but its coverage is far less from 30

Can Someone can help me with my confuse ?

datafield !
0 ?
1  0 如果设置Neutralization不是None可能会导致 long 和 short 都是 0因为datafield 可能全是正数datafield !
0 ?
1  0 得到的全为11,1,1,1...再中心化自然得到全为0根据 long 和 short 计算方法自然得到 0

必做1

long-count 指多头当alpha值为正时做多股票的数量

short-count 指空头当alpha值为负时做空股票的数量

必做2

直接输出可以分析出1100-1300家公司有这个数据

以5,22,66,252四个常用维度进行回测ts_std_devanl4_cff_flag,N

N5时可可以分析出大多数公司的值是不变的所以不是按周更新

N22时可可以分析出一两百家公司发生变化其他大多数公司的值是不变的所以不是按月更新

N66时400-800家公司发生改变

N252时几乎所有公司发生改变

所以推测是按照年度更新类似的数据集还有年收入等

Hi YZ84314, if you apply the backfill operators like ts_backfill, you can see the sum of long-short is around 1000, which is around 30 as data description says.
It seems the long and short count indicates the average count of each day in that year.

WC77208, yes it may not have the value 0 so all the instrument has the same value 1, so after neutralize it doesnt return any pnl.

YZ84314 Hello !
You should always use the visualization feature to check for coverage.
Sometimes data fields mentioned as 100 coverage also can have no values for particular datasetfields on a single day or more.
You can use some method to fill the NANs like that mentioned by ML65849.
For the particular datafield that you mentioned the coverage is 30 as mentioned in the field description

Universe One important concept of an alpha is universe.
The universe defines the set of working instruments.
Alpha performance often changes on different universes.
Robust alpha ideas show strong signals across universes.
However, there are certain alpha ideas that are validated only on specific universes.
Keep that in mind when you are creating alphas.Following the principles of robustness, the BRAIN operators are designed in such a way that they are independent from the working universes working across the universes and the universe constraint function is only applied at the last step to create the final alpha default behavior or when it is requested.
In other words, alpha expression ideas are applied to all the stocks available in the market by default.
However, we also provide the functions that allow you to limit alpha action in the working universe.Pasteurize The pasteurize function uses the universe information and then assigns inaccessible value NaN to all the instruments outside the working universe.
In fact, it is the last function added automatically to your expression.
Using the function with auto-pasteurize will apply pasteurize on the data beforehand as the input e.g., neutralization, rank.The pasteurize function allows you to create new universe limited operations.
Take the group_rank operation The regular group_rank data,sector will try to perform ranking across the US market where we have valid data  about 10,000 stocks  independent from the universe that you have selected.
However, the group_rank pasteurizedata,sector will try to rank at most 3,000 stocks on the TOP3000 universe and 200 stocks on the TOP200.
The different behavior leads to different performance.Cross-universe operations The pasteurize function has influenced your result if the operators require the computation across universes such as all group functions group_rank, group_mean, group_max, ....
Pasteurize, however, has no effect if the operators only depend on the data of a single instrument, such as the time series operators and regular arithmetic operators , -, , , max, min, etc..
The influence difference is small if the size of your working universe is large TOP3000 and is large if the size of the working universe is small TOP200.
Now you have some very important information that could lead to a number of new alphas.Suggestions

您好感谢您提出的问题我估计您的策略应该是在CHN Region上运行的众所周知中国市场并没有提供广泛的做空机制所以大多数股票不能直接做空并且中国有涨跌停板机制基于中国市场的各种特别机制我们在CHN Region设计了与USA Region的Sub-universe test类似的Robust universe test

在CHN Region中未通过该测试表明您策略的收益大部分超过60来自于一些较难交易或流动性较差的股票亦或者是你的头寸权重过多地配置到了某些股票上当然造成无法通过该测试的原因亦有可能包含更多其他的因素

通常来说您可以考虑通过如下两个办法进行改进首先您可以尝试使用类似于rank, hump, clamp等运算符平滑您的头寸权重再者您可能需要重新审视您的Alpha策略修改并使得其在各类股票上均具有稳健性

好的 谢谢老师

1我们知道在中国市场市值越小流动性越差的股票越难以做空所以如果你的alpha交易市值越大流动性越好的股票在robust universe里受到的影响就会越小想像一下如果你的alpha大部分的赚的钱都是通过做空一些在真实市场中无法做空的股票那么它的表现在robustuniverse里很自然的会下降2不同数据集对中国市场机制有不同的适应度比如分析师数据主要通过做多优秀的股票赚钱那么相比量价数据来说其受到做空限制机制的影响就会减小

There can be some reasons for sudden jumps

Encountering fluctuating results while researching Alphas is common.
Sometimes, Alphas may show poor performance dips in PNL in specific years, which can be confusing.
You can improve your Alphas performance by looking not just at the in-sample IS summary section but also the year-by-year results under the Aggregate Data.
Here are some tips

If your turnover chart shows short-period spikes, this could be due to using datafields with low coverage.
See the example below.

If the low coverage datafields lack some data at certain timestamps, the Alpha using this datafield would change all its positions.
This situation may result in a large reduction in coverage for these days, causing the Alpha to fail the concentrated weight test.
To tackle this, try filling operators like ts_backfill or group_backfill to lower spiking turnover and prevent low coverage.

If your turnover chart shows short-period spikes, this could be due to using datafields with low coverage.
See the example below.

If the low coverage datafields lack some data at certain timestamps, the Alpha using this datafield would change all its positions.
This situation may result in a large reduction in coverage for these days, causing the Alpha to fail the concentrated weight test.
To tackle this, try filling operators like ts_backfill or group_backfill to lower spiking turnover and prevent low coverage.


#### Why do performance dips happen?


#### How to improve dips in the in-sample period?


#### Other types of dips/spikes issues

There can be some reasons for sudden jumps

Encountering fluctuating results while researching Alphas is common.
Sometimes, Alphas may show poor performance dips in PNL in specific years, which can be confusing.

BookSize is assumed as 20 Mn on BRAIN

Here are tips that may help you improve the returns of your Alphas

Thanks for this post.Can you please also explain more on the second point?

Hi MK38033,

To elaborate, higher decay values mean you are averaging the Alpha weights over a longer period.
This will lower the Alpha turnover but also lessen the Alphas ability to keep pace with market changes.
Thus, the Alpha has fewer capabilities to capture profits.
Consequently, fewer returns are generated.

You should try to keep Turnover below 40 in your Alphas, and definitely below 70.
Ways to reduce turnover include

Instead of decay, one can also use a simple moving average value of the data field.
E.g.
ts_meandata field, 5 instead of data field.
This reduces spikes and thus reduces turnover

Thank you NL41370, The knowledge shared has helped a lot.

For example, if your Alpha is 1returns and if returns are 0 for a day, then you have INF value to the stock.
As it is not advisable to give high weightage to only one stock, pasteurizeAlpha can and should be used to replace that INF values by NAN values.

Please note that alphaNAN is different from alpha0 as a 0 Alpha value can be affected by operations like decay and neutralization and thus end up with non-zero value, but a NAN Alpha value will remain NAN even after the operations.

Imagine, that instrument x at some point in time belongs not to TOP 1000 but to TOP 2000 Universe.
Then pasteurizex will set NaN to this instrument.
This feature might be very useful when you are working with group operators that dont imply pasteurization.

Please note that alphaNAN is different from alpha0 as a 0 Alpha value can be affected by operations like decay and neutralization and thus end up with non-zero value, but a NAN Alpha value will remain NAN even after the operations.

Imagine, that instrument x at some point in time belongs not to TOP 1000 but to TOP 2000 Universe.
Then pasteurizex will set NaN to this instrument.
This feature might be very useful when you are working with group operators that dont imply pasteurization.

Average measure of daily trading activity turnover signifies how often an Alpha simulates trades.
It can be defined as the ratio of value traded to book size.
Daily Turnover  Dollar trading volumeBooksize.
Good Alphas tend to have lower turnover, since low turnover means lower transaction costs.
See Simulation results page for details on Alpha simulation results details.

Universe, within the BRAIN platform, is a set of trading instruments provided by the BRAIN platform.

Value Factor captures the effect of recent Alpha submissions on the performance of a combination of your Alphas taking into account three particular elements a the Alphas individual performance, b the diversity of recent Alpha submissions, and c the uniqueness of submissions as compared to your past submissions and those of other consultants.

Please note that value factor is related to payments for consultants while Dataset Value Score is related to the under-utilization of data.

Value Score is a measure which signifies underutilization of a dataset.
Consultants are advised to research and make Alphas using datasets with a higher value score.
Dont confuse this with Value Factor.

Number of values can vary across days.
Three dimensional structure.
E.g.
Only 3 sentiment values on 1 Jan, but 1 value on 2 Jan

Calculates additional, advanced metrics about Alpha performance increases simulation time.

Volume signifies how many trades have taken place for that stock.
You could google Use of volume in stock market predictions to understand how you can use it.
There are many technical indicators based on volume that you can model your Alphas around.

The volume-weighted average price VWAP is a trading benchmark calculated from price and volume by adding up the dollars traded for every transaction price multiplied by number of shares traded and dividing that by the total shares traded for the day.

BRAIN platform uses an Alpha to create a vector of weights, with each weight corresponding to one of the stocks in the selected universe.
These weights may or may not be market neutralized, as per your neutralization setting by market, industry, subindustry or none.
This creates a portfolio for each day in the simulation period, which can then be used to calculate that days Profit and Loss PnL.

Delay determines when your strategy takes positions on stocks, that is at what time during the day does it decide to buy and sell.Delay  1 means that positions are taken in the morning just before the market opens, i.e.
your code is run every day just before the market opens and can use data like open, close, high, low up to the previous day.When Delay  0, the positions are taken in the evening just before the market closes, i.e.
your code is run every day just before the market closes and can use data up to that day itself.Since Delay-0 uses more recent information it is likely that a Delay-0 strategy would have better performance than a similar Delay-1 strategy, however, this may not always be the case.

Decay is an operation that is applied to your Alphas output.

Bollinger bands are composed of three lines.
One of the more common calculations of Bollinger Bands uses a 20-day SMA for the middle band.
The upper band is calculated by taking the middle band and adding the daily standard deviation to that amount.
The lower band is calculated by taking the middle band minus the daily standard deviation.

Booksize refers to the amount of capital money used to trade during the simulation.
The Booksize used on the platform is constant and is set to 20 million every day throughout the simulation.

In financial markets, momentum refers to the empirical observation that asset prices that have been rising recently are likely to rise further and vice versa.
Within the framework of the efficient market hypothesis, momentum is one of the market anomalies based on return autocorrelations along with reversion, seasonality, momentum reversal that originate from the fact that investors immediate reactions may be improper and tend to adjust over time.

NaN stands for Not a Number.
It is used to indicate results of invalid operations like division by zero or if some data is unavailable.
Please see Documentation for NaN handling in simulation setting and FAQ for details.

Refers to the contribution of Alphas to the strategy.

Neutralization helps to reduce the risk by making strategies long-short market neutral.

On the BRAIN platform, to neutralize an Alpha, the raw Alpha values are split into groups, and then neutralized within each group - the mean is subtracted from each value.
In theory, there are other ways of neutralization as well for example, orthogonalization.

Risk factors are specific variables that systematically influence the expected return and volatility of an asset or portfolio, potentially leading to financial losses.
These factors encompass a wide range of systematic market-wide and unsystematic specific to an asset or issuer elements, including market, liquidity, industry, and style risks.
WorldQuant BRAIN provides risk factors neutralization in 3 modes 1 Slow Factors, 2 Fast Factors and 3 SlowFast Factors.

Risk-neutralized Alphas are Alphas that show orthogonal and unique returns after accounting for market, industries and style factors.
By controlling an Alpha for a broad set of common risk factors, its resulting return more accurately reflects the Alphas intended capture, minimizing exposure to undesired risk factors.

Alpha performance shall be robust under different scenarios robust performance among supersub universe, have performance if ported to other regions, etc.

Bollinger bands are composed of three lines.
One of the more common calculations of Bollinger Bands uses a 20-day SMA for the middle band.
The upper band is calculated by taking the middle band and adding the daily standard deviation to that amount.
The lower band is calculated by taking the middle band minus the daily standard deviation.

Booksize refers to the amount of capital money used to trade during the simulation.
The Booksize used on the platform is constant and is set to 20 million every day throughout the simulation.

Refers to the maximum amount of capital that can be allocated to an Alpha before its marginal profitability PnL from allocating another dollar falls below some desired level.

Daily market capitalization commonly referred to as market cap is the total market value of a companys outstanding shares of stock.
To calculate the market cap for a given company, multiply the total number of outstanding shares by the market price of a share.
Cap is a data field of Price-Volume-Dataset.

It is the expression used to combine the Alphas selected using the selection expression in a SuperAlpha.
The output of the combo expression is a set of daily weights for each of the selected Alphas.

WQBrain consultant is an independent contractor part-time flexible position that offers individuals the ability to provide services in the form of Alphas to WorldQuant from anywhere within their respective country and at their own schedule.

Instrument is a financial term for any tradeable security stocks, futures, currencies, bonds, ETFs, options, etc..
Please refer to FAQ and Financial Instruments wiki for more details .

Investability Constraints ensure that the positions taken by an Alpha are within the liquidity limits of the instruments.
This helps avoid significant market impact, which can negatively affect the Alphas profitability.
An Alpha that performs well under Investability Constraints will potentially have higher capacity and liquidity.

httpsplatform.worldquantbrain.comlearndocumentationadvanced-topicsgetting-started-investability-constrained-metrics

The IS Ladder test checks if Sharpe over the most recent years are consistently above respective minimum thresholds.
It is one of the statistical significance tests to reduce the possibility of false positive random signals.

The Leaderboard page for WorldQuant Challenge lists out the ranks of the participants based on their overall score.
Please see Documentation for more details.
Consultant Leaderboard is available for BRAIN consultants only.

Long-short neutral strategy is commonly used by hedge funds globally.
This involves allocating an equal dollar amount to long positions and short positions.
This type of strategy can then profit from a change in the spread between stocks.
You have also minimized exposure to the market in general, i.e.
the ability of this strategy to make a profit is not directly tied to the direction of the market either up or down.
Please watch video 4 min What is an Alpha for more details.

Margin is the profit per dollar traded calculated as PnL divided by total dollars traded for a given period.
See Simulation results for details on Alpha simulation results.

E.g.
Only one open price of Google on 1 Jan

A feature designed to enhance the liquidity and scalability of the Alphas.
It limits the daily position changes of instruments based on a fraction of their 20-day average daily volume adv20.
This ensures that the Alphas adjust positions less frequently in illiquid instruments, which can significantly reduce turnover and improve the Sharpe ratio of the sub-universe.

httpsplatform.worldquantbrain.comlearndocumentationconsultant-informationconsultant-features

Refer to Reversion.

The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers and can be more descriptive of that data set than the average.
Please refer here for details .

In financial markets, momentum refers to the empirical observation that asset prices that have been rising recently are likely to rise further and vice versa.
Within the framework of the efficient market hypothesis, momentum is one of the market anomalies based on return autocorrelations along with reversion, seasonality, momentum reversal that originate from the fact that investors immediate reactions may be improper and tend to adjust over time.

NaN stands for Not a Number.
It is used to indicate results of invalid operations like division by zero or if some data is unavailable.
Please see Documentation for NaN handling in simulation setting and FAQ for details.

Refers to the contribution of Alphas to the strategy.

Neutralization helps to reduce the risk by making strategies long-short market neutral.

On the BRAIN platform, to neutralize an Alpha, the raw Alpha values are split into groups, and then neutralized within each group - the mean is subtracted from each value.
In theory, there are other ways of neutralization as well for example, orthogonalization.

Watch Video 4 min long about long-short market neutral strategy.
Check DocumentationNeutralization and FAQ for details.

Operator is a set of mathematical or statistical techniques required to implement your Alpha ideas.

It is the real world performance on Alpha.
See Documentation Alphas page and IS, Semi OS and OS for details.

Company stock currently held by all shareholders.
Includes shares held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by the companys officers and insiders.

Overfitting here refers to changing the Alpha expression slightly in a nonsensical way, just to get a good IS Sharpe e.g.
slightly changing the constants in the expression, changing the power of a parameter from 2 to 2.5, static flip sign of some sectors etc.
This shouldnt be done since it will inevitably fail the OS test constraints.
Please watch video 6.5 min long How to Avoid Overfitting and see FAQ Alpha Performance for details.

Pasteurization replaces input values with NaN pasteurizes for instruments not in the Alpha universe.
When Pasteurize  On, inputs will be converted to NaN for instruments not in the universe selected in Simulation Settings.

Please see Simulation setting for details and FAQ for examples.

Refer to Base payment.

Refers to production status.
Only PROD Alphas, which are created and submitted only by BRAIN consultants, are available for use by WorldQuant in its investment strategies.

This correlation metric is determined by the Mmaximum Pearson correlation coefficient from comparing a given Alpha to all other Alphas submitted by all Brain consultants.

Profit and Loss PnL is the money that the positions and trades generate based on the simulation of an Alpha which means it is the amount of money lost made or made lost during the year, expressed in dollars.

daily_PnL  sum of size of position  daily_return for all instruments, where the daily return per instrument  todays close  yesterdays close  1.0.
See Simulation results page for details on Alpha simulation results.

A combination of region, delay, and dataset category.

An Alpha is defined by WorldQuant as a mathematical model that seeks to predict the future price movements of various financial instruments.
See articles on the Alphas page.

Alpha list is a tool to compare your Alphas and check the correlation of those Alphas with each other.
You can add your Alphas to a list using Alpha to list and Alpha lists tools available on the Alphas page and Simulate page in the right upper corner.
The same tool allows comparing PnL graphs of Alphas of the same list.

An Alpha created on a single dataset with relaxed submission checks.

Bollinger bands are composed of three lines.
One of the more common calculations of Bollinger Bands uses a 20-day SMA for the middle band.
The upper band is calculated by taking the middle band and adding the daily standard deviation to that amount.
The lower band is calculated by taking the middle band minus the daily standard deviation.

Booksize refers to the amount of capital money used to trade during the simulation.
The Booksize used on the platform is constant and is set to 20 million every day throughout the simulation.
Simulated profit is not reinvested, and simulated losses are replaced by cash injection into the portfolio.
See Simulation results page for details on Alpha simulation results.

Refers to the maximum amount of capital that can be allocated to an Alpha before its marginal profitability PnL from allocating another dollar falls below some desired level.

In financial markets, momentum refers to the empirical observation that asset prices that have been rising recently are likely to rise further and vice versa.
Within the framework of the efficient market hypothesis, momentum is one of the market anomalies based on return autocorrelations along with reversion, seasonality, momentum reversal that originate from the fact that investors immediate reactions may be improper and tend to adjust over time.

NaN stands for Not a Number.
It is used to indicate results of invalid operations like division by zero or if some data is unavailable.
Please see Documentation for NaN handling in simulation setting and FAQ for details.

Refers to the contribution of Alphas to the strategy.

Neutralization helps to reduce the risk by making strategies long-short market neutral.

On the BRAIN platform, to neutralize an Alpha, the raw Alpha values are split into groups, and then neutralized within each group - the mean is subtracted from each value.
In theory, there are other ways of neutralization as well for example, orthogonalization.

Risk factors are specific variables that systematically influence the expected return and volatility of an asset or portfolio, potentially leading to financial losses.
These factors encompass a wide range of systematic market-wide and unsystematic specific to an asset or issuer elements, including market, liquidity, industry, and style risks.
WorldQuant BRAIN provides risk factors neutralization in 3 modes 1 Slow Factors, 2 Fast Factors and 3 SlowFast Factors.

Risk-neutralized Alphas are Alphas that show orthogonal and unique returns after accounting for market, industries and style factors.
By controlling an Alpha for a broad set of common risk factors, its resulting return more accurately reflects the Alphas intended capture, minimizing exposure to undesired risk factors.

The skewness value can be positive or negative, or even undefined.
Please refer Detailed operator descriptions for details on skewness.

Standard deviation is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of data values.
It indicates how much individual data points in a datafield deviate from the datafields mean average value.
A low standard deviation means that the data points tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.

Its impossible to predict one stocks future return.
Statistical arbitrage is an investment methodology that utilizes mean reversion to analyze a large universe of diverse stocks.
This analytical approach to trading aims to reduce exposure to beta as much as possible.
Hence, one stock error because of noisy data, calculation error, etc.
will not hurt the whole performance.

The volume-weighted average price VWAP is a trading benchmark calculated from price and volume by adding up the dollars traded for every transaction price multiplied by number of shares traded and dividing that by the total shares traded for the day.

BRAIN platform uses an Alpha to create a vector of weights, with each weight corresponding to one of the stocks in the selected universe.
These weights may or may not be market neutralized, as per your neutralization setting by market, industry, subindustry or none.
This creates a portfolio for each day in the simulation period, which can then be used to calculate that days Profit and Loss PnL.

Enough theory for now, lets delve into how to write your first alpha on the BRAIN platform.

No Coding Experience Required

To all the non-coders, the good news of using BRAIN is that no prior coding experience is required.

BRAINs Way of Coding

BRAIN uses the fast expression language that consists of two main elements Data fields and Operators.

Can I use Python  R  MATLAB etc.
for Alphas?

One of our user has asked us Are there plans to allow users to utilize PythonMATLABR to interact with the BRAIN API, to analyze datasets and submit the alpha vectors?

Our reply is that the BRAIN platform is currently available for use only with Fast Expressions language.
Regarding APIs, we currently do not prohibit programmatic access to BRAIN platform when API communication is conducted with low intensity.
The BRAIN team has not yet published any official API documentation though.

Data Fields, Datasets

Data fields refer to a named collection of data, for example open price or close price.

Datasets are a collection of data fields.
For example, open price and close price can be found in the price volume dataset here.
Most users typically start out with price volume and fundamental datasets.

Operators

An Operator is a set of mathematical or statistical techniques required to implement your Alpha ideas, for example mathematical operators  -   or cross-sectional operators such as rank.
Read LearnOperators for more details.

Here are some common examples of alphas build using data fields and operators

You can try out some sample alphas by clicking on the Example button bottom left corner on the simulator page.
Leverage the hint and test out a few simulations!

Finance Basics

Many of our consultants started out from non-financial specializations, so dont be worried if you dont have prior financial knowledge.
This section will brush you up with some basic know-how.

How the Stock Market works

The stock market refers to public markets that exist for issuing, buying, and selling stocks that trade on a stock exchange or over-the-counter.
Stocks, also known as equities, represent fractional ownership in a company, and the stock market is a place where investors can buy and sell ownership of such investible assets 1.

Seeking Returns

Investors seek to profit from buying stocks by selling their stock for a profit if the stock price increases from their purchase price.
For example, if an investor buys shares of a companys stock at 10 a share and the price of the stock subsequently rises to 15 a share, the investor can then realize a 50 profit on their investment by selling their shares 1.
Returns is defined by WorldQuant as the return on capital traded Annual Return  Annualized Profit  Loss  Half of Capital Traded.
It signifies the amount made or lost during the period and is expressed in .

Long a Stock

Taking a long position in a stock simply means buying it, and if the stock increases in value, you will make money.

Short a Stock

On the other hand, taking a short position in a stock means borrowing an equity that you do not own, usually from your broker, then selling it, and hoping that it declines in value.
When that happens, you can buy it back at a lower price than you have paid for it and return the borrowed shares to your broker.

Defining Volume

Volume is the amount of an asset or security that changes hands over some period of time, often over the course of a day.
For instance, stock trading volume could refer to the number of shares of a security traded between its daily open and close.
Trading volume, and changes to volume over the course of time, are important inputs for technical traders 2.

Defining what is Close  Open Price

The opening price is the price at which a security first trades upon the opening of an exchange on a trading day.
The closing price is the price of the final trade before the close of the trading session.
These prices are important because they are used to create traditional line stock charts, as well as when calculating moving averages and other technical indicators 3,4.

All teams that have unlocked the early access of the stage 2 merged performance score on the IQC leaderboard, will be eligible for stage 2.
For this, at least one member of the team needs to attain 10,000 qualifier points.

In the previous editions

Hence your first goal is 10,000 qualifier points in Stage 1.
After that, shift your focus to Merged Performance Score, as it is the metric that determines success in later stages.

As a thumb rule, merged performance score improves or reduces based on the quality of the Alpha rather than the number of Alphas submitted.
So a team with fewer Alphas could have a higher merged PnL than a team with more Alphas.

More number of Alphas with low correlation can increase the merged performance.
Large number of high correlation Alphas could reduce your merged performance.

Note you unlock merged performance score only after you or your team member reaches 10,000 qualifier points.
One to three Alphas a day can help you reach the max possible 2,000 qualifier points per person per day.

There are two components of IQC Stage 1 Score

Team unlocks merged performance on the IQC leaderboard when at least one team member reaches 10,000 qualifier points

Merged Performance  25 of IS Score  75  of OS Score

IS Score  D1 Score  D0 Score3

The metrics that impact the Stage 1 Score are

Turnover.
The larger this parameter the worse the score with all other parameters to be the same.
Decreasing turnover below 12.5, with all other parameters the same, may not necessarily improve your score.

If you have achieved the individual qualifier score of 10,000 points then in the results section on the right side of the simulate screen, scroll down to the Performance Comparison section and click the dropdown arrow.

The Before Submission and After Submission shows how your teams IQC Stage 1 score will change, if you submit this Alpha.
Please note that this can be a negative result, as shown in the below image.

The table IS Performance After Submission shows how the individual metrics of IQC Stage 1 scoring Sharpe, Turnover, Returns, Drawdown of the merged performance series will change if you submit this Alpha.

Note The PnL Plot is only for reference.
If the PnL after submission plot shows a reduction but the table IS Performance after Submission shows an increase, then submitting the Alpha would improve your score

The webinars would cover different datasets and other tips

Diversification generally improves the performance of a portfolio of alphas.
The forum has tips to get started with multiple datasets

Some other tips that could help

You can divide your In-Sample IS period into a Train and Test period.
The Train period can be utilized to develop your Alphas and SuperAlphas, while the Test period is ideal for validating them.
An Alpha developed based on the simulation results of Training Period and performs well in both periods is likely a strong candidate for submission and may have avoided overfitting.
To learn more about overfitting and how to overcome it, read Here.

Important parameters that influence the merged performance score are

Merge performance turnover.
The larger this parameter the worse the score with all other parameters to be the same.
Decreasing turnover below 12.5, with all other parameters the same, may not necessarily improve your score.

As a rule of thumb, Alphas that perform better, would lead to better merged performance.
By perform better, we mean high Sharpe, high Returns, high Fitness, low Turnover and low correlation.

Number of Alphas More Alphas with low correlation can increase the merged performance.
Large number of high correlation Alphas could reduce your merged performance.

Hello, I doubt this question.
There is no path, as illustrated in the example.
Am I mistaken?
If not, can you please clear up the question a bit more?

As for the said problem statement and hint, the following implementation might work C.

includebitsstdc.h using namespace std

int main int n cin  n vectorvectorint gridn, vectorintn, 0, dpn, vectorintn, 0 forint i  0 i  n i  forint j  0 j  nj  cin  gridij  dp00  grid00 forint i  1  i  n i dpi0  dpi-10  gridi0 forint i  1i  n i  dp0i  dp0i-1  grid0i forint i  1 i  n i  forint j  1  j  n j  dpij  gridij  mindpij-1, dpi-1j   cout  dpn-1n-1 endl return 0

样例感觉不太对劲

得到的dp矩阵

结果为

1311127

## Searching for fields based on an idea


## Searching for fields based on specific criteria


## Comments


## Didn't find what you were looking for?

Quants often develop alphas using the below framework.
Start with an idea hypothesis find suitable data and operators to implement the idea then keep improving the implementation until satisfied with the result.

Mapping the idea to data can make your alphas distinctive.
Powered by advanced AI technologies, such as NLP, The Data Explorer helps you quickly and accurately identify the data fields to implement your idea.

Lets say you have an alpha idea using market sentiment.
You can easily search for related datasets and data fields in the Data Explorer.
Notice that you will have to pre-define region, delay and universe prior to your search.

You can filter data fields based on criteria such as coverage, type, count of alphas and users.
For example, you can search for high coverage data fields from Company Fundamental Data for Equity dataset in CHN region and were used in at least 5 submitted alphas.
You can later sort these data fields by alpha count to see which fields are used less, i.e., less crowded.

Dont limit yourself to these usages, there are many more way to utilize this feature.

I would like to propose adding a feature to sort the most used data by data category as well.
This feature will show which data categories are used the most, thereby supporting alpha.

I think there might be a simpler approach, which is to go directly to the data explorer, alpha test, get good results, then draw out the alpha idea.

Thank you so much for sharing such a great n wonderful information .
Your points and explanations help us to improve our work quality.Great tips.

The Data Explorer is a powerful tool for identifying relevant data fields to implement your alpha ideas, especially when using advanced technologies like NLP.
By searching for fields based on your hypothesis, such as market sentiment, you can quickly pinpoint the right datasets.
Additionally, the ability to filter data fields by criteria like coverage, type, and user count allows you to refine your search further, ensuring you find the most suitable data for your strategy.
Dont hesitate to explore various ways to use this feature to enhance your alpha development process.

No.

When two teams merge, note that all Alphas from both teams must pass all submission checks, including self-correlation, with respect to all submitted Alphas from both teams.
This means that some Alphas may fail submission tests during the merge process.
When Alphas fail a self-correlation test, the Alpha with the highest fitness will be counted towards the score.

As a thumb rule, merged performance score improves or reduces based on the quality of the Alpha rather than the number of Alphas submitted.
So a team with fewer Alphas could have a higher merged PnL than a team with more Alphas.

More number of Alphas with low correlation can increase the merged performance.
Large number of high correlation Alphas could reduce your merged performance.

Note you unlock merged performance score only after you or your team member reaches 10,000 qualifier points.
One to three Alphas a day can help you reach the max possible 2,000 qualifier points per person per day.

## Didn't find what you were looking for?

Consider two different industries A and B, both having two stocks eachA 2,4B 0,2Applying alpha-meanalpha for neutralization Neutralization within industry A will give the following values -1 and 1.
Similarly, neutralization within industry B will give the following values -1 and 1.Now, after neutralization, we follow the process of normalization in which we divide the alpha values by the sum of absolute values.
In this example, the sum equals 4.After normalization, the values become -14,14,-14,14.We multiply this by the booksize of 20 million to get the amount we want to invest on each of the stocks, where a positive sign indicates taking a long position and negative sign indicates taking a short position.
Also, since the positive values add up to 0.5 and the negative values add up to -0.5, we end up investing 10 million in long positions and 10 million in short positions.

Youre outlining a neutralization and normalization process to manage the allocation of investments based on alpha values, adjusting for industry-specific biases, and ensuring a balanced exposure across positions.

Thank you for explaining the process of neutralization and normalization in this context.
The clear breakdown of how the alpha values are adjusted within each industry and the subsequent normalization step is really helpful.
I also appreciate the insight into how the booksize is used to determine the investment amount, ensuring a balanced long-short strategy.

How would the process of neutralization and normalization change if one industry had significantly more stocks than the other?
For example, if Industry A had 5 stocks and Industry B had only 2, how would that affect the allocation and the balance of the long-short strategy?
Thank you for your sharing.

The alpha values are divided by the sum of the absolute values of the alphas to ensure the total sum of the alpha values is zero and the total investment is equally divided between long and short positions.

这一期的问题让我们来讨论一个有趣的现象如果我们用一个密封的锅子煮水那么总有一个水分子在煮开前的某一刻和煮开后的某一刻处于同样的位置

基于下列的假设请给出这个现象的通俗或数学证明

假设水分子在煮沸过程中的位置改变是连续的而不是突然跳跃到另一个位置

锅子是封闭的锅子不是开放的水分子不可能会逃逸到锅子外部

布劳威尔不动点定理的简单应用具体地

每一个从一个欧几里得空间的某个给定的凸紧子集射到它自身的连续函数都有至少一个不动点

设fx是定义在集合XRn上的实函数且fxX,xX

对于条件1题目中已经给出水分子在煮沸过程中的位置改变是连续的对应函数关系fx是连续的

对于条件2题目已给出锅子是封闭的满足非空紧凸集的拓扑定义一定有完全边界且任何存在极限的X包含的元素序列的极限点属于X

因此符合不动点定理的结论在一锅水分子X中至少存在一个水分子xX使得fxx即至少有一个水分子自始至终都处在原位

设有n个水分子为w_1,...w_n, 其各自初始位置为x_1, ...
,x_n in O subset mathbbR3.
终止位置为y_1,...,y_n in O subset mathbbR3, 其中O是单连通闭集.
则考虑一个映射T mathbbR3 - mathbbR3 使得Tx_i  y_i.
则T是定义在mathbbR3上的有界算子由延拓定理可以构造出连续的T使得TO  O且Tx_i  y_i.又有mathbbR3在考虑二范数对应的度量下为完备度量空间考虑Banach不动点定理可知存在一个x in O使得Tx  x.

但是这只保证了在T这个映射下水壶内部空间的映射会有一个不动点并不代表水分子会有一个在同样位置毕竟空间内的水分子是有限集在连续空间是稀疏的且测度为0.

倘若忽视物理规律认为有无限多个水分子或者说是考虑定义处于同样位置为更弱的条件或许会更好又或者说实际上考虑到了分子在这个过程中的布朗运动或许更多的条件需要被考虑进来

When water is heated in a closed pot, the energy supplied to the system increases the kinetic energy of the water molecules.
Some water molecules gain enough energy to overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction holding them together and transition from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase, forming water vapour.But not all of the molecules gain significant energy to transition into water vapour.Also the process of boiling is a dynamic equilibrium between liquid water and water vapour.
As water molecules gain energy and enter the gas phase, an equal number of gas molecules lose energy and return to the liquid phase.Now, lets consider a specific water molecule in the pot.
Eventually, the water molecule may gain enough energy to transition into the gas phase.
At this point, it detaches from its original position in the liquid and becomes part of the water vapour.
However, due to the continuous nature of molecular motion, another water molecule from the gas phase will inevitably collide with the liquid surface and occupy the vacant position left by the vapourized water molecule.In this way the specific molecule may change, but the overall distribution and arrangement of molecules remain relatively constant.

YZ61104 考虑得非常周全

沸腾前和沸腾后是两个动态平衡的状态水分子完全相同占据锅内某个空间位置的概率对所有水分子一样假设考虑某一个精确的锅内的空间位置其占据概率对与所有锅内水分子是相等的假设连续变化锅内所有水分子都在该位置占据过那么下一时刻必然有与之前重复的某个特定水分子在此占据该位置

终止位置为y_1,...,y_n in O subset mathbbR3, 其中O是单连通闭集.
则考虑一个映射T mathbbR3 - mathbbR3 使得Tx_i  y_i.
则T是定义在mathbbR3上的有界算子由延拓定理可以构造出连续的T使得TO  O且Tx_i  y_i.又有mathbbR3在考虑二范数对应的度量下为完备度量空间考虑Banach不动点定理可知存在一个x in O使得Tx  x.

但是这只保证了在T这个映射下水壶内部空间的映射会有一个不动点并不代表水分子会有一个在同样位置毕竟空间内的水分子是有限集在连续空间是稀疏的且测度为0.

倘若忽视物理规律认为有无限多个水分子或者说是考虑定义处于同样位置为更弱的条件或许会更好又或者说实际上考虑到了分子在这个过程中的布朗运动或许更多的条件需要被考虑进来

When water is heated in a closed pot, the energy supplied to the system increases the kinetic energy of the water molecules.
Some water molecules gain enough energy to overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction holding them together and transition from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase, forming water vapour.But not all of the molecules gain significant energy to transition into water vapour.Also the process of boiling is a dynamic equilibrium between liquid water and water vapour.
As water molecules gain energy and enter the gas phase, an equal number of gas molecules lose energy and return to the liquid phase.Now, lets consider a specific water molecule in the pot.
Eventually, the water molecule may gain enough energy to transition into the gas phase.
At this point, it detaches from its original position in the liquid and becomes part of the water vapour.
However, due to the continuous nature of molecular motion, another water molecule from the gas phase will inevitably collide with the liquid surface and occupy the vacant position left by the vapourized water molecule.In this way the specific molecule may change, but the overall distribution and arrangement of molecules remain relatively constant.

沸腾前和沸腾后是两个动态平衡的状态水分子完全相同占据锅内某个空间位置的概率对所有水分子一样假设考虑某一个精确的锅内的空间位置其占据概率对与所有锅内水分子是相等的假设连续变化锅内所有水分子都在该位置占据过那么下一时刻必然有与之前重复的某个特定水分子在此占据该位置

This is a common problem many researchers face in their alpha research  you are not alone.
First, lets look at the good side of the problem.
If the correlation between alphas is high, that means you have probably implemented similar ideas, so it is unlikely that you did something wrong.
Your idea and implementation should be sound assuming the original alpha had good performance.So if you are new researcher, you should keep the idea around because it can be used for different alphas.
Those alphas can be a variation of the current alpha using

The reason to try something equivalent first is to reduce the chance that you distort the implementation of your original idea.
Maintain the purity of the idea rather than complicate it unnecessarily for the sake of correlation fitting which is considered bad practice.Of course, the best way to reduce max correlation is to think outside of the box.
That is true research.

Nice suggestions

I hope Brain can expand the maximum number of times correlation can be retrieved from API or checked manually.
Currently, I often exceed the limit when checking correlation, which makes it very difficult to do alpha.
I hope Brain will consider improving.
Thank you.

Hello, I would like to ask if self corr and prod corr are equally important in evaluating value factor?
I find self corr controllable but prod corr is very difficult.
Hope to get an answer.
Thank you.

Hi TN48752!

I think that both self and prod correlations are important.

If your original alpha uses momentum on closing prices

Appreciate this post, very insightful topic!

Blend your alpha with a complementary signal that targets unrelated patterns.

Change the time scale of the alphas calculations.

Introduce additional independent variables or modify existing ones to enhance diversity.

Redefine the scope or grouping of the alphas calculation.

Modify the mathematical or logical operator in the alpha calculation.

Replace existing data fields with similar ones to derive variations of the original alpha idea.

I think that both self and prod correlations are important.
but prod correlations depends on other consultant and that is much high.

High correlation in Alphas often indicates similar ideas, which isnt necessarily bad.
To reduce correlation, experiment with equivalent data fields, operators, or groupings while preserving the core ideas integrity.
Avoid arbitrary changes for correlation fitting.
True innovation lies in thinking outside the box for unique and diversified Alpha ideas.

## Comments


## Didn't find what you were looking for?

Broadly speaking, a high capacity alpha can be associated with three major norms high liquidity, low correlation and low turnover.
Of these, the most significant contributor to the increase in capacity is low turnover.
By definition, low turnover means that the alpha is trading with less frequency  which means fewer transactions are being processed and in that way we have the capability to trade more easily.
Hence, we are increasing the capacity of the alpha.
There are many ways of reducing wasteful turnover of an alpha.
A very basic method is the hump operation.
This operation is supposed to analyze the alpha values of an existing alpha and then manipulate some of them to reduce the turnover of that alpha.Basic Idea In general, for a normal alpha the value changes every day per its formula.
Many times the alphas value doesnt change significantly, yet the alpha still has to simulate a trade.
The simulated PnL generated in these transactions is not that great, but the transaction costs involved are still pretty high.
This is wasteful turnover that can be reduced smartly with simple techniques.
We can define a threshold in terms of the percentage of change in the alpha value and simulate a trade only when the percentage change crosses that threshold value.Improvement The single threshold value could be variable depending upon market conditions different ways of evaluating  e.g., movementvolatility of index.Each instrument could have a variable threshold liquiditymarket-capvolatility.There can also be a single threshold value for a group subindustrysectorcustom group.Increasing the threshold values either uniformly or not uniformly after ranking the instruments on the basis of a few factors market-capvolatility can help.Future direction The impact of volatility is much more important than any other factor for deciding the capacity of the alpha, and also the individual thresholds of stocks in the hump operation.
Looking at it a bit differently, try to think in line with an event alpha.
Keep monitoring the short-term volatility of the stock, and also keep a sense of average long-term stock volatility.
Whenever the stock volatility has a spike and crosses a certain customizable threshold, the alpha starts simulating a trade as per its values, with the idea that this is the period in which the alpha might generate simulated profits.
For the other times, we keep holding the stock, or alternatively we can continue with the previous hump operation during these times but with a much stricter threshold.

Thank you for the detailed explanation of high capacity alphas and the significance of low turnover!
How could variable thresholds based on factors like liquidity, market capitalization, or volatility be applied to improve the performance of the hump operation?
Can you think of a scenario where adjusting these thresholds for specific instruments or groups could significantly enhance alpha capacity?

Whenever the stock volatility has a spike and crosses a certain customizable threshold, the alpha starts simulating a trade as per its values, with the idea that this is the period in which the alpha might generate simulated profits.
For the other times, we keep holding the stock, or alternatively we can continue with the previous hump operation during these times but with a much stricter threshold.

Broadly speaking, a high capacity alpha can be associated with three major norms high liquidity, low correlation and low turnover.
Of these, the most significant contributor to the increase in capacity is low turnover.
By definition, low turnover means that the alpha is trading with less frequency  which means fewer transactions are being processed and in that way we have the capability to trade more easily.
Hence, we are increasing the capacity of the alpha.
There are many ways of reducing wasteful turnover of an alpha.
A very basic method is the hump operation.
This operation is supposed to analyze the alpha values of an existing alpha and then manipulate some of them to reduce the turnover of that alpha.Basic Idea In general, for a normal alpha the value changes every day per its formula.
Many times the alphas value doesnt change significantly, yet the alpha still has to simulate a trade.
The simulated PnL generated in these transactions is not that great, but the transaction costs involved are still pretty high.
This is wasteful turnover that can be reduced smartly with simple techniques.
We can define a threshold in terms of the percentage of change in the alpha value and simulate a trade only when the percentage change crosses that threshold value.Improvement The single threshold value could be variable depending upon market conditions different ways of evaluating  e.g., movementvolatility of index.Each instrument could have a variable threshold liquiditymarket-capvolatility.There can also be a single threshold value for a group subindustrysectorcustom group.Increasing the threshold values either uniformly or not uniformly after ranking the instruments on the basis of a few factors market-capvolatility can help.Future direction The impact of volatility is much more important than any other factor for deciding the capacity of the alpha, and also the individual thresholds of stocks in the hump operation.

Hi,

Yes the above is true.
But please note, do not overfit your alpha, to cross the 10 sharpe threshold.

Focus on diversifying signals, reducing overlap with past alphas, or tweaking parameters to lower correlation without overfitting.

As a thumb rule, merged performance score improves or reduces based on the quality of the Alpha rather than the number of Alphas submitted.
So a team with fewer Alphas could have a higher merged PnL than a team with more Alphas.

More number of Alphas with low correlation can increase the merged performance.
Large number of high correlation Alphas could reduce your merged performance.

Note you unlock merged performance score only after you or your team member reaches 10,000 qualifier points.
One to three Alphas a day can help you reach the max possible 2,000 qualifier points per person per day.

thank you

Hopefully Brain will consider expanding the 1 month D0 alpha submission limit.
Currently 30 D0 alphas is quite low, hopefully this number will be pushed higher 60 - 90.
Thanks.

Your insights into creating effective D0 alphas are incredibly valuable!
The breakdown of strategies, from leveraging D0-specific data like price-volume and open price to exploring event-driven and sentiment-based approaches, offers a clear roadmap for beginners and experienced participants alike.
Thank you!

thank you for this.

Delay 0 D0 alphas utilize same-day data for faster trading.
Start with D1 concepts adapted to D0 data like price-volume or sentiment.
Explore news-based triggers, group reversion, and technical indicators applied to sentiment or fundamental data.
Focus on liquid universes and low-turnover datasets for effective D0 strategies with unique behavior.

D0 alphas trade using data from the same day, often providing more immediate market reactions compared to D1 alphas, which use data from the previous day.
To create effective D0 alphas, you can start with D1 alpha ideas, but adapt them to use more timely data like price, volume, and news.
For instance, using open prices and calculating group reversion can help predict stock movements based on collective trends.
Additionally, news and sentiment data can act as event triggers for strategies, while reversion concepts can be tested using sentiment indicators like RSI.
D0 alphas often excel in liquid universes and work well with low-turnover datasets, such as fundamentals and analyst data, as well as group or relationship datasets.

Very insightful, will definitely give DO alphas a try

### 1. What does the linear decay function do?


### 2. Does the decay function change the input data?


### 3. Why does this happen?


### 4. Why is the default decay set to 4?


### 5. Effect on Alpha Construction


## Didn't find what you were looking for?

The Decay function in the Alpha settings block is a linear decay function over a period of n days where the value on day t is equal to the weighted average of the values from day t to day t-n.

What exactly does this do to the alpha?
Does this linear decay function change all input data being used in the alpha?
So the actual values are not being used, but rather every input value is changed to a weighted average?
In this case, why is the default decay set to 4?

Related to

7 comments

Decay does not change the input values, it performs a weighted average on the output of your Alpha.
The output of your Alpha is a vector of weights.
The value of the weights get smoothened by the Decay operator.
As a crude example- if in the recent 5 days, the Alpha provides weight of 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 to one stock.
So AlphaToday  0.8, Alpha today -1  0.6 and so on.

Then after Decay  5.
The AlphaToday will be replaced byalpha_modified  5alphatoday  4alphatoday-1  ...
 1alphatoday-4  15  0.53No specific reason for default setting of 4.

Thanks for the response!
I understand what Decay actually does.
A follow up question if I may - Is the purpose of Decay to reduce the variance in weights assigned to a particular stock over multiple days?
If so, what is the fundamental logicrationale behind doing so?
If not, why is Decay even necessary?

Thanks in advance!

Your question contains the answer .
Decay helps manage variance.
Variance is another form of risk.There are multiple explanations regarding Decay on the platform Decay can helps smooth the Alpha values, reduce turnover, manage risk etc.

Thanks again!

Hey KK28219!
You got it right.
The decay function mainly aims to manage variance indeed.
By smoothing the Alpha values, it makes the weights assigned to stocks more stable over time.
This helps reduce turnover too as it wont change the weights drastically.
And as variance is a form of risk, managing it is crucial for a better-performing strategy.
Theres no fixed rule for the default setting of 4, but its a common choice to start with and adjust based on your specific needs.

The Decay function in the Alpha settings block applies a linear decay to the input data used in your alpha expression.
It modifies how past data points are weighted when calculating the alpha value.
Heres a detailed explanation of how it works and its effect

The decay function effectively weights the input data over a period of n days.
For each day t, it computes a weighted average of the data from the previous n days, where more recent data points are given a higher weight, and older data points are given progressively lower weights.
The decay function smooths the data to reflect a time-dependent weighting, so recent data points influence the alpha more than older ones.

Yes, the decay function modifies the input data.
Instead of using the raw values for each day, it uses the decayed value, which is the weighted average of the data from day t-n to day t.

This means

The purpose of the decay is to give more importance to recent information while reducing the influence of older data.
This is important for capturing more timely signals in a dynamic market.
Markets tend to change over time, and recent data is often more relevant than older data.

The default decay of 4 is likely a balanced choice for capturing recent market signals while still incorporating some historical context.
The idea is

A decay of 4 is a reasonable starting point for many alphas, as it reflects recent market behavior while considering a short history of data.

When the decay is applied, it impacts how the signals and inputs interact over time.
The smoothed inputs will produce an alpha that is less volatile and more focused on trends, rather than sharp, sudden movements.
It can help reduce noise in the alpha signal, making it more stable and reducing overfitting to short-term data.

### 1. What does the linear decay function do?


### 2. Does the decay function change the input data?


### 3. Why does this happen?


### 4. Why is the default decay set to 4?


### 5. Effect on Alpha Construction

The Decay function in the Alpha settings block is a linear decay function over a period of n days where the value on day t is equal to the weighted average of the values from day t to day t-n.

What exactly does this do to the alpha?
Does this linear decay function change all input data being used in the alpha?
So the actual values are not being used, but rather every input value is changed to a weighted average?
In this case, why is the default decay set to 4?

Decay does not change the input values, it performs a weighted average on the output of your Alpha.
The output of your Alpha is a vector of weights.
The value of the weights get smoothened by the Decay operator.
As a crude example- if in the recent 5 days, the Alpha provides weight of 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 to one stock.
So AlphaToday  0.8, Alpha today -1  0.6 and so on.

Then after Decay  5.
The AlphaToday will be replaced byalpha_modified  5alphatoday  4alphatoday-1  ...
 1alphatoday-4  15  0.53No specific reason for default setting of 4.

Thanks for the response!
I understand what Decay actually does.
A follow up question if I may - Is the purpose of Decay to reduce the variance in weights assigned to a particular stock over multiple days?
If so, what is the fundamental logicrationale behind doing so?
If not, why is Decay even necessary?

Thanks in advance!

Your question contains the answer .
Decay helps manage variance.
Variance is another form of risk.There are multiple explanations regarding Decay on the platform Decay can helps smooth the Alpha values, reduce turnover, manage risk etc.

Thanks again!

Hey KK28219!
You got it right.
The decay function mainly aims to manage variance indeed.
By smoothing the Alpha values, it makes the weights assigned to stocks more stable over time.
This helps reduce turnover too as it wont change the weights drastically.
And as variance is a form of risk, managing it is crucial for a better-performing strategy.
Theres no fixed rule for the default setting of 4, but its a common choice to start with and adjust based on your specific needs.

The Decay function in the Alpha settings block applies a linear decay to the input data used in your alpha expression.
It modifies how past data points are weighted when calculating the alpha value.
Heres a detailed explanation of how it works and its effect

The decay function effectively weights the input data over a period of n days.
For each day t, it computes a weighted average of the data from the previous n days, where more recent data points are given a higher weight, and older data points are given progressively lower weights.
The decay function smooths the data to reflect a time-dependent weighting, so recent data points influence the alpha more than older ones.

Yes, the decay function modifies the input data.
Instead of using the raw values for each day, it uses the decayed value, which is the weighted average of the data from day t-n to day t.

This means

The purpose of the decay is to give more importance to recent information while reducing the influence of older data.
This is important for capturing more timely signals in a dynamic market.
Markets tend to change over time, and recent data is often more relevant than older data.

The default decay of 4 is likely a balanced choice for capturing recent market signals while still incorporating some historical context.
The idea is

用户您好感谢您提出的问题我想从三方面回答您的问题

首先我们来看这行表达式的意思我认为这个表达式首先计算了近三天即最近一天和两天前收盘价的差值并取负数负数取值后对数值进行排序具体排序运算请查看该链接rank运算后的数值即作为该股票的raw alpha value.

接着我们来查看一下对raw alpha value如何操作使之成为对股票执行有意义的向量详细的操作我相信您可以在这篇文章中找到简单地来说它包含如下步骤

股票的Weight值代表该股票在完整投资组合中的权重它的工作原理是这样的

最后我们每一天都执行这样的计算进行新的交易

希望这样的回复能对您的理解提供一些参考具体的细节请以BRAIN平台上显示的交易结果为准

了解十分感謝你詳細的說明

Struggling with the same issue, any answers yet?

Did you check if the enddates are same in both the simulations?

yes I sure enddates and all setting are same, just different in multi -1, have you tested it ?
Do you get similar result?

No, we see exactly same results i.e.
-2.12 sharpe.
Make sure you have same settings of delya, truncation, etc in both the alphas

Adding to the above response, post simulation of the alpha, we see the reverse alpha has the opposite, but exactly the same metrics as the original alpha.

The settings for alpha simulation are as in the query

It seems like you are trying to reverse the result of your alpha by simply multiplying it by -1.
However, the changes in performance metrics Sharpe, Fitness, and Return do not directly follow a simple reversal.
This could be due to the underlying relationships between the components of your alpha and the risk-return characteristics of the model.

Lets walk through a few key points to understand why this may be happening and how you might be able to achieve the reversed result you want

To get a reversed result with Sharpe 2.12, Fitness 0.9, and Return 18.29, here are a few suggestions

Instead of just multiplying by -1, consider adjusting the alpha expression or using additional transformation methods that take into account the underlying risk-return structure

Multiplying your alpha by -1 might not guarantee the perfect reversal of Sharpe, Return, and Fitness because the relationships between the model and the underlying market are not always perfectly linear.
To get the desired reversal, you may need to modify the alpha expression further e.g., adjusting the components, risk measures, or using different transformations and refine the portfolio construction to achieve the expected performance metrics.

Let me know if youd like more detailed suggestions or assistance in refining the alpha!

Hey, NT13880!
The reason multiplying by -1 didnt reverse the results as expected is that the relationship between the alpha and performance metrics isnt linear.
Sharpe, Fitness, and Return are affected by multiple factors like risk and non-linearities in the model.
To get the reverse results you want, try adjusting the alpha expression, like changing factor weights or using alternative sign reversal methods.
Also, pay attention to portfolio construction and volatility adjustments.
Hope this helps!

The issue youre encountering seems to be related to how multiplying by -1 affects the alpha signals and the resulting metrics.
In theory, multiplying an alpha by -1 should reverse the direction of the alpha signal i.e., flipping long signals to short, and vice versa.
However, several factors might explain why the resulting Sharpe ratio, Fitness, and Return arent reversed in the way you expect.

A simple idea while working on a news dataset could be as followsEvent Detection For a particular stock, identify the day on which news related to that stock is occurring you can do this by checking NaN and non-NaN values.Assignment Once the related event found in the news information is identified, the position for that stock can be taken as the effect on the percentage change in the stocks price because of the news.Holding the position For the remaining days, you can simply hold the position that you have assigned.Following the above steps an alpha could be trade_whennews_tot_ticks, news_pct_5_min,-1Scope of Improvement In this case, the improvement can be done at all three levels.The event detection can be done through various other ways as well, and different detection methods can change your alpha expression significantly.
You can think of some other ways of assignment by looking at the news data fields in the Learn section.
Also, instead of just holding the alpha, you can improve the alpha performance by setting thresholds or decaying the alpha.
All insights or improvements are welcome!

Thank you for sharing this insightful framework for working with a news dataset and constructing an alpha.
What are some alternative approaches to improve the alpha, such as incorporating market-wide news or using machine learning to predict news-driven price movements?

Thank you for sharing this straightforward and practical approach to event detection and alpha creation.
I wonder have you experimented with different methods for event detection, such as using sentiment analysis or keyword matching, to refine the alpha further?

Instead of only detecting whether news is related to a stock or not, you can incorporate sentiment analysis.
This can classify news as positive, negative, or neutral, allowing the alpha to react differently based on the sentiment.
For example, if a news event is positive, the algorithm could assign a long position, whereas if its negative, it could assign a short position.

A simple idea while working on a news dataset could be as followsEvent Detection For a particular stock, identify the day on which news related to that stock is occurring you can do this by checking NaN and non-NaN values.Assignment Once the related event found in the news information is identified, the position for that stock can be taken as the effect on the percentage change in the stocks price because of the news.Holding the position For the remaining days, you can simply hold the position that you have assigned.Following the above steps an alpha could be trade_whennews_tot_ticks, news_pct_5_min,-1Scope of Improvement In this case, the improvement can be done at all three levels.The event detection can be done through various other ways as well, and different detection methods can change your alpha expression significantly.
You can think of some other ways of assignment by looking at the news data fields in the Learn section.
Also, instead of just holding the alpha, you can improve the alpha performance by setting thresholds or decaying the alpha.
All insights or improvements are welcome!

## Didn't find what you were looking for?

As I wrote in the title, my alpha longs onlye.g., long count 2000, short count 0, even though I neutralized it.
I did not neutralize it myself, I used the market neutralize option in the settings.

How is this possible?
Shouldnt the weight sum to zero after the neutralization?

Thanks for your help in advance!

It would help if you could share details about the Alpha expression.
Some operators could have led to this scenario.

The split field is the key here.
Stock splits are very rare events and for most of the instruments, it is always equal to 1.
So, if you look at the cross-section i.e.
across instruments, for most days you will see all 1s.
Neutralizing them across any groupnot just market and irrespective of you use it in settings or using group_neutralize in alpha expression, will give you all 0s and 0 is counted as long.
Hence, sum of alpha values post-neutralization is still 0.

Oh, so 0 is counted as long.
Thanks!

Yeah, HJ39505, thats right.
As PK56323 explained, since 0 is counted as long in this case, even after the market neutralization, you end up with only long positions showing.
Its due to the nature of the split field where most values are 1 and neutralizing them results in 0s being treated as long.
Thats why the weight sum doesnt work as you expected.
Hope this clears it up for you.

Yes, ideally, after using market neutralization, the weight sum should be close to zero.
If youre still seeing only long positions with no shorts, its possible that the neutralization method in your settings isnt fully balancing the positions, or there could be an issue with how the model is interpreting or applying the neutralization.
Double-check the neutralization settings e.g., the specific factor or method used to ensure its properly applied.
If the problem persists, it might be worth reviewing the underlying data or model logic to identify any potential issues.

The market neutralization option helps reduce factor exposure but does not guarantee a perfectly balanced set of long and short positions.
The key takeaway is that neutralization removes systematic factor exposure, not necessarily the imbalance between long and short positions.
To achieve a balanced long-short portfolio, you may need to experiment with custom neutralization or adjust your alpha signal more directly e.g., by using ranking or quantiles.

An Alpha is defined by WorldQuant as a mathematical model that seeks to predict the future price movements of various financial instruments.
See articles on the Alphas page.

Alpha list is a tool to compare your Alphas and check the correlation of those Alphas with each other.
You can add your Alphas to a list using Alpha to list and Alpha lists tools available on the Alphas page and Simulate page in the right upper corner.
The same tool allows comparing PnL graphs of Alphas of the same list.

An Alpha created on a single dataset with relaxed submission checks.

Bollinger bands are composed of three lines.
One of the more common calculations of Bollinger Bands uses a 20-day SMA for the middle band.
The upper band is calculated by taking the middle band and adding the daily standard deviation to that amount.
The lower band is calculated by taking the middle band minus the daily standard deviation.

Booksize refers to the amount of capital money used to trade during the simulation.
The Booksize used on the platform is constant and is set to 20 million every day throughout the simulation.
Simulated profit is not reinvested, and simulated losses are replaced by cash injection into the portfolio.
See Simulation results page for details on Alpha simulation results.

Refers to the maximum amount of capital that can be allocated to an Alpha before its marginal profitability PnL from allocating another dollar falls below some desired level.

Daily market capitalization commonly referred to as market cap is the total market value of a companys outstanding shares of stock.
To calculate the market cap for a given company, multiply the total number of outstanding shares by the market price of a share.
Cap is a data field of Price-Volume-Dataset.

It is the expression used to combine the Alphas selected using the selection expression in a SuperAlpha.
The output of the combo expression is a set of daily weights for each of the selected Alphas.

Make use of the visualization feature to analyze the coverage of the data fields.
Read this BRAIN Forum Post to know more about coverage handling.

A named collection of data, which has constant type and business meaning.
For example, open price is of constant type numeric, and it consistently means the price of a security at the starting time of the trading period.
Close price has the same type as open price, but its a different field as it differs in business meaning.

A source of information on one or more variables of interest for the WorldQuant investment process.
A collection of data fields.
For example price volume data for US equities or analyst target price predictions for US equities.

Type of field which has information about instrument segregation into various groups.
They are supposed to be used as an input to the group operator.
Some grouping type fields are industry, subindustry and sector

An illiquid universe refers to the collection of instruments associated with low liquidity.
Such a universe is subjected to lower trading volumes and is generally associated with higher transaction costs.

An industry is a group of companies that are related based on their primary business activities.
Industry classifications are typically grouped into larger categories called sectors.
Please refer here for more details .

Information ratio IR measures the potential predictive ability of a model.
In the BRAIN platform, it is defined as the ratio of a simulated portfolios mean daily returns to the volatility of those returns.
Please watch video 7 min on simulation results and see DocumentationAlpha Performance for details.

In-sample performance of an Alpha is the performance obtained from backtesting on historical data.
This is the performance you see on the results page when simulating an Alpha.
See Documentation for Alphas page and IS, Semi OS and OS for details.

Instrument is a financial term for any tradeable security stocks, futures, currencies, bonds, ETFs, options, etc..
Please refer to FAQ and Financial Instruments wiki for more details .

Investability Constraints ensure that the positions taken by an Alpha are within the liquidity limits of the instruments.
This helps avoid significant market impact, which can negatively affect the Alphas profitability.
An Alpha that performs well under Investability Constraints will potentially have higher capacity and liquidity.

httpsplatform.worldquantbrain.comlearndocumentationadvanced-topicsgetting-started-investability-constrained-metrics

The IS Ladder test checks if Sharpe over the most recent years are consistently above respective minimum thresholds.
It is one of the statistical significance tests to reduce the possibility of false positive random signals.
Check Documentation for details.

Kurtosis is the fourth central standardized moment of time-series vector X.
For time-series vector X values distribution, kurtosis could be treated as a measure of how heavy or how thin the tails of the distribution are.
Please see Operators description for more details about ts_kurtosisx, d operator.

Liquidity describes the ease with which an asset or security can be bought or sold in the market without affecting its price significantly.
WorldQuant BRAIN provides different universes classifying instruments on the basis of their liquidity, with smaller universes being more liquid.

The Leaderboard page for WorldQuant Challenge lists out the ranks of the participants based on their overall score.
Please see Documentation for more details.
Consultant Leaderboard is available for BRAIN consultants only.

Long-short neutral strategy is commonly used by hedge funds globally.
This involves allocating an equal dollar amount to long positions and short positions.
This type of strategy can then profit from a change in the spread between stocks.
You have also minimized exposure to the market in general, i.e.
the ability of this strategy to make a profit is not directly tied to the direction of the market either up or down.
Please watch video 4 min What is an Alpha for more details.

Margin is the profit per dollar traded calculated as PnL divided by total dollars traded for a given period.
See Simulation results for details on Alpha simulation results.

The total dollar market value of a companys outstanding shares.

Basic type of field which has just one value of every date and instrument.
There is no special syntax for using this in simulation.
Some examples of matrix fields are close, returns, cap.

Has one value on one day for one security.
Two dimensional structure.
E.g.
Only one open price of Google on 1 Jan

A feature designed to enhance the liquidity and scalability of the Alphas.
It limits the daily position changes of instruments based on a fraction of their 20-day average daily volume adv20.
This ensures that the Alphas adjust positions less frequently in illiquid instruments, which can significantly reduce turnover and improve the Sharpe ratio of the sub-universe.

Refer to Reversion.

The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers and can be more descriptive of that data set than the average.
Please refer here for details .

In financial markets, momentum refers to the empirical observation that asset prices that have been rising recently are likely to rise further and vice versa.
Within the framework of the efficient market hypothesis, momentum is one of the market anomalies based on return autocorrelations along with reversion, seasonality, momentum reversal that originate from the fact that investors immediate reactions may be improper and tend to adjust over time.

NaN stands for Not a Number.
It is used to indicate results of invalid operations like division by zero or if some data is unavailable.
Please see Documentation for NaN handling in simulation setting and FAQ for details.

Refers to the contribution of Alphas to the strategy.

Neutralization helps to reduce the risk by making strategies long-short market neutral.

On the BRAIN platform, to neutralize an Alpha, the raw Alpha values are split into groups, and then neutralized within each group - the mean is subtracted from each value.
In theory, there are other ways of neutralization as well for example, orthogonalization.

Watch Video 4 min long about long-short market neutral strategy.
Check DocumentationNeutralization and FAQ for details.

Operator is a set of mathematical or statistical techniques required to implement your Alpha ideas.

It is the real world performance on Alpha.
See Documentation Alphas page and IS, Semi OS and OS for details.

Company stock currently held by all shareholders.
Includes shares held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by the companys officers and insiders.

Overfitting here refers to changing the Alpha expression slightly in a nonsensical way, just to get a good IS Sharpe e.g.
slightly changing the constants in the expression, changing the power of a parameter from 2 to 2.5, static flip sign of some sectors etc.
This shouldnt be done since it will inevitably fail the OS test constraints.
Please watch video 6.5 min long How to Avoid Overfitting and see FAQ Alpha Performance for details.

Pasteurization replaces input values with NaN pasteurizes for instruments not in the Alpha universe.
When Pasteurize  On, inputs will be converted to NaN for instruments not in the universe selected in Simulation Settings.
When Pasteurize  Off, this operation does not happen and all available inputs are used.
Please see Simulation setting for details and FAQ for examples.

Refer to Base payment.

Refers to production status.
Only PROD Alphas, which are created and submitted only by BRAIN consultants, are available for use by WorldQuant in its investment strategies.

This correlation metric is determined by the Mmaximum Pearson correlation coefficient from comparing a given Alpha to all other Alphas submitted by all Brain consultants.

Profit and Loss PnL is the money that the positions and trades generate based on the simulation of an Alpha which means it is the amount of money lost made or made lost during the year, expressed in dollars.

It is probably because in some years, markets were more volatile than in others.
Please do not bet in the direction of market and instead, use the neutralization operation.
If your drawdown remains very high, then you might consider modifying your idea or its implementation.

The max drawdowns depend on the idea itself.
One idea could underperform in one year, another idea could perform in another year.
Some ideas may even perform better in a volatile period than in other years.

Neutralization helps to reduce the risk by making strategies long-short market neutral.

On the BRAIN platform, to neutralize an Alpha, the raw Alpha values are split into groups, and then neutralized within each group - the mean is subtracted from each value.
In theory, there are other ways of neutralization as well for example, orthogonalization.

Struggling with the same issue, any answers yet?

Did you check if the enddates are same in both the simulations?

yes I sure enddates and all setting are same, just different in multi -1, have you tested it ?
Do you get similar result?

No, we see exactly same results i.e.
-2.12 sharpe.
Make sure you have same settings of delya, truncation, etc in both the alphas

Adding to the above response, post simulation of the alpha, we see the reverse alpha has the opposite, but exactly the same metrics as the original alpha.

The settings for alpha simulation are as in the query

It seems like you are trying to reverse the result of your alpha by simply multiplying it by -1.
However, the changes in performance metrics Sharpe, Fitness, and Return do not directly follow a simple reversal.
This could be due to the underlying relationships between the components of your alpha and the risk-return characteristics of the model.

Lets walk through a few key points to understand why this may be happening and how you might be able to achieve the reversed result you want

To get a reversed result with Sharpe 2.12, Fitness 0.9, and Return 18.29, here are a few suggestions

Instead of just multiplying by -1, consider adjusting the alpha expression or using additional transformation methods that take into account the underlying risk-return structure

Multiplying your alpha by -1 might not guarantee the perfect reversal of Sharpe, Return, and Fitness because the relationships between the model and the underlying market are not always perfectly linear.
To get the desired reversal, you may need to modify the alpha expression further e.g., adjusting the components, risk measures, or using different transformations and refine the portfolio construction to achieve the expected performance metrics.

Let me know if youd like more detailed suggestions or assistance in refining the alpha!

Hey, NT13880!
The reason multiplying by -1 didnt reverse the results as expected is that the relationship between the alpha and performance metrics isnt linear.
Sharpe, Fitness, and Return are affected by multiple factors like risk and non-linearities in the model.
To get the reverse results you want, try adjusting the alpha expression, like changing factor weights or using alternative sign reversal methods.
Also, pay attention to portfolio construction and volatility adjustments.
Hope this helps!

The issue youre encountering seems to be related to how multiplying by -1 affects the alpha signals and the resulting metrics.
In theory, multiplying an alpha by -1 should reverse the direction of the alpha signal i.e., flipping long signals to short, and vice versa.
However, several factors might explain why the resulting Sharpe ratio, Fitness, and Return arent reversed in the way you expect.

您好感谢您提出的问题我估计您的策略应该是在CHN Region上运行的众所周知中国市场并没有提供广泛的做空机制所以大多数股票不能直接做空并且中国有涨跌停板机制基于中国市场的各种特别机制我们在CHN Region设计了与USA Region的Sub-universe test类似的Robust universe test

在CHN Region中未通过该测试表明您策略的收益大部分超过60来自于一些较难交易或流动性较差的股票亦或者是你的头寸权重过多地配置到了某些股票上当然造成无法通过该测试的原因亦有可能包含更多其他的因素

通常来说您可以考虑通过如下两个办法进行改进首先您可以尝试使用类似于rank, hump, clamp等运算符平滑您的头寸权重再者您可能需要重新审视您的Alpha策略修改并使得其在各类股票上均具有稳健性

好的 谢谢老师

1我们知道在中国市场市值越小流动性越差的股票越难以做空所以如果你的alpha交易市值越大流动性越好的股票在robust universe里受到的影响就会越小想像一下如果你的alpha大部分的赚的钱都是通过做空一些在真实市场中无法做空的股票那么它的表现在robustuniverse里很自然的会下降2不同数据集对中国市场机制有不同的适应度比如分析师数据主要通过做多优秀的股票赚钱那么相比量价数据来说其受到做空限制机制的影响就会减小

Pros

Cons

ApproachDefine events Any spike in returns, data values and technical indicators can be used to define events.Alpha assignment Look for signals that are aligned with the abnormality of an event  that is, alphas that need to be executed when such events happen.NoteHold alpha can be replaced by decaying alpha linearly or exponentially.Check alpha coverage to make sure events are not so rare.

KA64574, what does -1 do in the expression

Hi ,

The general format of trade_when operator is the following

Trade_When xtriggerTradeExp, yAlphaExp, ztriggerExitExp

z  triggerExitExp is basically the exit condition for the alpha .
triggerExitExp  -1 means that the positions taken will not be exited .

Please do refer to the following page where you would find a more detailed explanation of the trade_when operator

httpsplatform.worldquantbrain.comlearndata-and-operatorsdetailed-operator-descriptions10-trade_when

Such great content.
Thanks for sharing.

What does Hold alpha values means?

As event driven alphas have relevant values in case of rare events, such as company specific event, hold alpha value means holding position in the stock according to the expression in else parentheses logic for Hold alpha values instead of a NaN value.

Thanks

Could you please give an example of how to Hold alpha can be replaced by decaying alpha linearly or exponentially?
thank you

What is event_condition , please explain with an alpha as example.

Hi!

Could you please give an example of how to Hold alpha can be replaced by decaying alpha linearly or exponentially?
thank you

Lets say event_condition is a particular condition youre interested in, and alpha_expression is the alpha you want to decay.

Now, your expression could look like this

In this configuration, if event_condition is true, we take the alpha_expression value.
If its false, we average the current alpha_expression value and the alpha_expression value at the time of the last event.
This gradually decays the alpha.

You can also use days_from_last_changeevent_condition to assign more or less weight to the old alpha expression, controlling the rate of decay.

What is event_condition , please explain with an alpha as example.

An example of event_condition could be something like rankvolumeadv20  0.5.
So the alpha will be executed when the rank of the ratio of volume to adv20 exceeds 0.5.

So, an example alpha expression with event_condition might look like

thanks for providing these expression.

Event-driven Alphas use targeted triggers to assign Alpha values during defined events while holding or decaying values otherwise.
They offer good coverage, low turnover, and flexibility in timing trades.
However, achieving high Sharpe or returns can be challenging.
Ensure events are frequent enough to maintain meaningful Alpha coverage and signal relevance.

D1 alphas trade in the morning using data from the previous day D0 alphas trade in the evening using data from the same day.
In practice, if an alpha idea makes sense, often it will have better results in D0 because the alpha is reacting to the most recent market information.However, using the latest information can also lead to overreaction, which could hurt performance.
Also, there are datasets that are delayed by nature such as fundamental and analyst data  in those cases D0 does not have a significant information advantage and hence the performance could be worse.Of course, what weve described above applies only for true alpha signals  if the input is not a true alpha signal, the chance of D0 being better or worse than D1 is 5050.If the D1 performance of your alpha is better than the D0 performance, it is likely that your D0 version is not a true D0 alpha or that your initial D1 idea is not a true alpha.
So please double check if you see that happen.

I would like to ask why the backtest pass requirement of alpha D0 is much higher than alpha D1 eg sharpe  2.69 for USA

I would like to ask why many regions do not have alpha D0 for example ASI, GLB, KOR,...
Or only big markets like USA, CHN, EUR allow creating alpha D0.
Hope to get an answer

D0 alphas trade in the evening using the latest same-day data, allowing them to react quickly to recent market information.D1 alphas trade the next morning using data from the previous day, potentially offering a more measured response.

D0 AdvantagesAccess to the most recent market information gives D0 alphas an edge in responding to timely opportunities.Particularly effective for signals based on intraday or high-frequency data.D0 RisksOverreaction to short-term noise can lead to diminished performance.Datasets with natural delays e.g., fundamentals, analyst updates reduce the value of same-day trading, making D1 performance comparable or even better.D1 AdvantagesBeneficial when trading on datasets that inherently have lagging updates or slower market incorporation, such as fundamentals.May avoid the pitfalls of overreacting to noisy data, offering smoother and more reliable performance.

thank you PH82915, verry clearly to understand

The distinction between D1 and D0 alphas is an important consideration when analyzing the timing of trading strategies, and it plays a significant role in determining the performance of your alpha.
Lets break down the key aspects of each and understand why D1 alphas may outperform D0 alphas or vice versa, and what it means for the quality of your alpha signal.

Thank you for sharing!
This explanation highlights the importance of evaluating alpha signals in both D0 and D1 contexts.
Its crucial to ensure the signals validity and avoid overfitting to recent data, which can distort performance.

## Increase your alpha return


## Reduce your Volatility


## Comments


## Didn't find what you were looking for?

Often there is no best answer for this general question, so we would suggest you first need to understand the Sharpe or the related metric, information ratio IR.IR  Return  standard_deviation ReturnBased on this formula, there are two ways to improve IR

If you think of alpha as a prediction of the return, then increasing the return often means you are predicting the return better.
In other words, the more information you have, the better your prediction.
You can predict short term with pricevolume data or news and long term with fundamental, analyst or news data, just to name a few possibilities.
A simple prediction model is often more robust, but the performance may be low, while a more complex model will often generate a higher return, but beware of overfitting

To reduce your volatility you may want to understand where it comes from One way is to think about the instability of a stock and the market.
Neutralization can often help reduce the exposure to the overall market or a certain group within it with high volatility.The more you work on Brain, the more you will gain techniques to improve your signals  nothing can replace hard work.
For the beginner, we suggest you spend time on the Learn section of the Brain platform and on the Community forum where you can get insights from other experienced researchers.

Really appreciate this, its a valuable topic!

To boost Sharpe

To achieve a higher Sharpe ratio, you can focus on the two components of the Sharpe formula

Sharpe Ratio or IR  Return  Volatility

a.
Enhance Signal Quality

b.
Diversify Your Inputs

c.
Target High-Impact Areas

d.
Improve Model Complexity

e.
Maximize Alpha Persistence

a.
Neutralization

b.
Portfolio Construction

c.
Reduce Overtrading

d.
Monitor Exposure

e.
Stabilize Input Data

If your alpha uses momentum based on price movements, you can

could you provide a valid example about that?

Thank you for the insightful overview of the Sharpe ratio and the information ratio.
Are there other metrics that you find more informative when trying to measure the success of your alpha strategies?

Often there is no best answer for this general question, so we would suggest you first need to understand the Sharpe or the related metric, information ratio IR.IR  Return  standard_deviation ReturnBased on this formula, there are two ways to improve IR

If you think of alpha as a prediction of the return, then increasing the return often means you are predicting the return better.
In other words, the more information you have, the better your prediction.
You can predict short term with pricevolume data or news and long term with fundamental, analyst or news data, just to name a few possibilities.
A simple prediction model is often more robust, but the performance may be low, while a more complex model will often generate a higher return, but beware of overfitting

To reduce your volatility you may want to understand where it comes from One way is to think about the instability of a stock and the market.
Neutralization can often help reduce the exposure to the overall market or a certain group within it with high volatility.The more you work on Brain, the more you will gain techniques to improve your signals  nothing can replace hard work.
For the beginner, we suggest you spend time on the Learn section of the Brain platform and on the Community forum where you can get insights from other experienced researchers.

## Comments


## Didn't find what you were looking for?

Broadly speaking, a high capacity alpha can be associated with three major norms high liquidity, low correlation and low turnover.
Of these, the most significant contributor to the increase in capacity is low turnover.
By definition, low turnover means that the alpha is trading with less frequency  which means fewer transactions are being processed and in that way we have the capability to trade more easily.
Hence, we are increasing the capacity of the alpha.
There are many ways of reducing wasteful turnover of an alpha.
A very basic method is the hump operation.
This operation is supposed to analyze the alpha values of an existing alpha and then manipulate some of them to reduce the turnover of that alpha.Basic Idea In general, for a normal alpha the value changes every day per its formula.
Many times the alphas value doesnt change significantly, yet the alpha still has to simulate a trade.
The simulated PnL generated in these transactions is not that great, but the transaction costs involved are still pretty high.
This is wasteful turnover that can be reduced smartly with simple techniques.
We can define a threshold in terms of the percentage of change in the alpha value and simulate a trade only when the percentage change crosses that threshold value.Improvement The single threshold value could be variable depending upon market conditions different ways of evaluating  e.g., movementvolatility of index.Each instrument could have a variable threshold liquiditymarket-capvolatility.There can also be a single threshold value for a group subindustrysectorcustom group.Increasing the threshold values either uniformly or not uniformly after ranking the instruments on the basis of a few factors market-capvolatility can help.Future direction The impact of volatility is much more important than any other factor for deciding the capacity of the alpha, and also the individual thresholds of stocks in the hump operation.
Looking at it a bit differently, try to think in line with an event alpha.
Keep monitoring the short-term volatility of the stock, and also keep a sense of average long-term stock volatility.
Whenever the stock volatility has a spike and crosses a certain customizable threshold, the alpha starts simulating a trade as per its values, with the idea that this is the period in which the alpha might generate simulated profits.
For the other times, we keep holding the stock, or alternatively we can continue with the previous hump operation during these times but with a much stricter threshold.

Thank you for the detailed explanation of high capacity alphas and the significance of low turnover!
How could variable thresholds based on factors like liquidity, market capitalization, or volatility be applied to improve the performance of the hump operation?
Can you think of a scenario where adjusting these thresholds for specific instruments or groups could significantly enhance alpha capacity?

Good topic!!!
Moreover, in my opinion the fundamental based alphas is way more returns than regular operators ones.

How increases fitness and returns any key idea of alpha patterns

Hi MS18311!

Please check out Alpha Template and Research section on Global Consultant Community for Staying Ahead

Good.
Well understood.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVICE.
THESE TIPS ARE VERY HELPFUL.

thank you for this tips.
thats really good.

To enhance Alpha returns, focus on higher turnover, lower decay values, and smaller, more liquid universes.
Balancing returns and drawdowns while increasing volatility can also boost performance.
Leverage news and analyst datasets for innovative Alpha ideas, as they often provide actionable insights with strong return potential.
Experiment and optimize strategically.

Great insights on enhancing alpha performance!
Increasing turnover and optimizing decay values can indeed maximize returns.
Incorporating news and analyst datasets is a smart movetimely data drives better predictions.
Balancing liquidity and volatility is also key.
Thanks

Important parameters that influence the merged performance score are

Merge performance turnover.
The larger this parameter the worse the score with all other parameters to be the same.
Decreasing turnover below 12.5, with all other parameters the same, may not necessarily improve your score.

As a rule of thumb, Alphas that perform better, would lead to better merged performance.
By perform better, we mean high Sharpe, high Returns, high Fitness, low Turnover and low correlation.

Number of Alphas More Alphas with low correlation can increase the merged performance.
Large number of high correlation Alphas could reduce your merged performance.

## Didn't find what you were looking for?

Turnover is the amount of change in a position over booksize.

Lets say you have only a single stock with position a as of yesterday.
The new position today for that stock is b.
Turnover is defined as b-a  booksizeLets assume booksize is 1, so a and b can be any number between -1 and 1.
Lets also assume you are fully invested and when a  1 you buy the stock.If b  a, you have no change in the position, and turnover is 0.If b  0, you liquidate the entire position, and the turnover   0 - 1  1  100.If b  -a, you would flip the position from buy to sell, and the turnover   -1 - 1   1  200.So now you can see how you can have turnover more than 100.

This is a wonderful topic, thanks for highlighting it!

Thank you for the clear explanation of turnover and its implications in position management!

Turnover is a measure of the change in position size and provides insight into the trading activity or the frequency of trades.
Its an important metric for understanding how much of a portfolios assets have been turned over or changed over a given period.

Understood!
Turnover measures the magnitude of position change relative to the total booksize, and it can exceed 100 when positions are reversed e.g., from fully long to fully short.
This provides a clear way to quantify trading activity and its impact on the portfolio.

Simply put, if you see a stock is growing, you will buy and sell a lot.
It will bring high profits but also comes with high risks.

KA64574, what does -1 do in the expression

Hi ,

The general format of trade_when operator is the following

Trade_When xtriggerTradeExp, yAlphaExp, ztriggerExitExp

z  triggerExitExp is basically the exit condition for the alpha .
triggerExitExp  -1 means that the positions taken will not be exited .

Please do refer to the following page where you would find a more detailed explanation of the trade_when operator

httpsplatform.worldquantbrain.comlearndata-and-operatorsdetailed-operator-descriptions10-trade_when

Such great content.
Thanks for sharing.

What does Hold alpha values means?

As event driven alphas have relevant values in case of rare events, such as company specific event, hold alpha value means holding position in the stock according to the expression in else parentheses logic for Hold alpha values instead of a NaN value.

Thanks

Could you please give an example of how to Hold alpha can be replaced by decaying alpha linearly or exponentially?
thank you

What is event_condition , please explain with an alpha as example.

Hi!

Could you please give an example of how to Hold alpha can be replaced by decaying alpha linearly or exponentially?
thank you

Lets say event_condition is a particular condition youre interested in, and alpha_expression is the alpha you want to decay.

Now, your expression could look like this

In this configuration, if event_condition is true, we take the alpha_expression value.
If its false, we average the current alpha_expression value and the alpha_expression value at the time of the last event.
This gradually decays the alpha.

You can also use days_from_last_changeevent_condition to assign more or less weight to the old alpha expression, controlling the rate of decay.

What is event_condition , please explain with an alpha as example.

An example of event_condition could be something like rankvolumeadv20  0.5.
So the alpha will be executed when the rank of the ratio of volume to adv20 exceeds 0.5.

So, an example alpha expression with event_condition might look like

thanks for providing these expression.

Event-driven Alphas use targeted triggers to assign Alpha values during defined events while holding or decaying values otherwise.
They offer good coverage, low turnover, and flexibility in timing trades.
However, achieving high Sharpe or returns can be challenging.
Ensure events are frequent enough to maintain meaningful Alpha coverage and signal relevance.

### On Overfitting and Random Data Mining


### Tests to Mitigate Overfitting


### Tips and Tricks to Reduce Overfitting


### Using the Test Period Feature


### Collaboration and Community


### Final Thoughts


## Didn't find what you were looking for?

We have to accept the fact that fitting is a part of the alpha creation process.
As a result, overfitting is also part of the game.
The most important way to control for overfitting is by doing disciplined research.

Is overfitting bad?
Yes, it is.
However, random data mining research without ideas is even worse.
Robust alphas require good ideas and rigorous testing.
Here are some of the tests you can use to reduce the chance for overfitting and improve the robustness of your alphas.

Dont limit yourself to what is listed here.
There are tests that can be done based on your creativity and experience the more you do the better.
By the way, random backtest is often not very applicable due to changing market conditions.Here are some other tips and tricks

Using the test period feature in settings to prevent overfitting

Using simulation settings, you can divide your In-Sample IS period into a Train and Test period.
The Train period can be utilized to develop your Alphas and SuperAlphas, while the Test period is ideal for validating them.
An Alpha developed based on the simulation results of Training Period and performs well in both periods is likely a strong candidate for submission and may have avoided overfitting.

Can you share example of binary test?

If I understood correctly, binary test means applying the sign operator to the whole alpha expression to see if the performance still holds when the magnitude component of its prediction is removed.

yes, that is one way of binary test.
You can also use conditional operators to implement binary test.

Use normal look back periods like 5,20,60,252 in your alpha and also stop fine tuning parameters like powers etc.
excessively

Your insights on overfitting and disciplined alpha research are crucial for building robust and sustainable models in quantitative finance.
Heres a structured breakdown and enhancement of your points

Rank Test

Binary Test

SubSuper Universe Test

Other Creative Tests

Avoid Overweighting Volatile Stocks

Reduce Factor Exposure

Prefer Second Best

Dont Fit to Tests

Blend Similar Parameters

Validate Out-of-Sample

Guard Against the Excellent Trap

Train-Test Split

Criteria for Robustness

Avoid Look-Ahead Bias

The balance between flexibility and discipline is key in alpha development.
While overfitting is a natural risk in quantitative modeling, the combination of robust testing, creative exploration, and a clear validation framework can significantly mitigate its impact.

Would you like to dive deeper into any specific test or technique?
Or discuss practical applications of these ideas?

Hey!
To avoid overfitting, first do disciplined research as mentioned.
Then use those tests like rank test, binary test etc.
Also, dont focus too much on volatile stocks and reduce factor exposure.
Dont just pick the best but consider the second best sometimes.
Avoid fitting to tests and dont be too selective.
Using the test period feature in settings to split IS into Train and Test periods helps a lot too.
That way we can develop and validate alphas better and dodge overfitting.

Hello, I would like to ask how does binary test work in detail in checking overfitting?
There is some data when signdata then pnl is 0 straight line

Creating robust alphas involves a balance between data fitting and disciplined testing.
The key to avoiding overfitting is ensuring that the alpha performs well across different market conditions, test periods, and universes.
Additionally, incorporating various robustness checks, like rank tests, binary tests, and subsuper universe tests, is crucial.
By focusing on strong hypotheses, minimizing complexity, and validating performance out-of-sample, you can develop alphas that are not only effective in the past but also have the potential to perform well in the future.

The Train period can be utilized to develop your Alphas and SuperAlphas, while the Test period is ideal for validating them.
An Alpha developed based on the simulation results of Training Period and performs well in both periods is likely a strong candidate for submission and may have avoided overfitting.

We have to accept the fact that fitting is a part of the alpha creation process.
As a result, overfitting is also part of the game.
The most important way to control for overfitting is by doing disciplined research.

Is overfitting bad?
Yes, it is.
However, random data mining research without ideas is even worse.
Robust alphas require good ideas and rigorous testing.
Here are some of the tests you can use to reduce the chance for overfitting and improve the robustness of your alphas.

Dont limit yourself to what is listed here.
There are tests that can be done based on your creativity and experience the more you do the better.
By the way, random backtest is often not very applicable due to changing market conditions.Here are some other tips and tricks

## Comments


## Didn't find what you were looking for?

Broadly speaking, a high capacity alpha can be associated with three major norms high liquidity, low correlation and low turnover.
Of these, the most significant contributor to the increase in capacity is low turnover.
By definition, low turnover means that the alpha is trading with less frequency  which means fewer transactions are being processed and in that way we have the capability to trade more easily.
Hence, we are increasing the capacity of the alpha.
There are many ways of reducing wasteful turnover of an alpha.
A very basic method is the hump operation.
This operation is supposed to analyze the alpha values of an existing alpha and then manipulate some of them to reduce the turnover of that alpha.Basic Idea In general, for a normal alpha the value changes every day per its formula.
Many times the alphas value doesnt change significantly, yet the alpha still has to simulate a trade.
The simulated PnL generated in these transactions is not that great, but the transaction costs involved are still pretty high.
This is wasteful turnover that can be reduced smartly with simple techniques.
We can define a threshold in terms of the percentage of change in the alpha value and simulate a trade only when the percentage change crosses that threshold value.Improvement The single threshold value could be variable depending upon market conditions different ways of evaluating  e.g., movementvolatility of index.Each instrument could have a variable threshold liquiditymarket-capvolatility.There can also be a single threshold value for a group subindustrysectorcustom group.Increasing the threshold values either uniformly or not uniformly after ranking the instruments on the basis of a few factors market-capvolatility can help.Future direction The impact of volatility is much more important than any other factor for deciding the capacity of the alpha, and also the individual thresholds of stocks in the hump operation.
Looking at it a bit differently, try to think in line with an event alpha.
Keep monitoring the short-term volatility of the stock, and also keep a sense of average long-term stock volatility.
Whenever the stock volatility has a spike and crosses a certain customizable threshold, the alpha starts simulating a trade as per its values, with the idea that this is the period in which the alpha might generate simulated profits.
For the other times, we keep holding the stock, or alternatively we can continue with the previous hump operation during these times but with a much stricter threshold.

Thank you for the detailed explanation of high capacity alphas and the significance of low turnover!
How could variable thresholds based on factors like liquidity, market capitalization, or volatility be applied to improve the performance of the hump operation?
Can you think of a scenario where adjusting these thresholds for specific instruments or groups could significantly enhance alpha capacity?

Good topic!!!
Moreover, in my opinion the fundamental based alphas is way more returns than regular operators ones.

How increases fitness and returns any key idea of alpha patterns

Hi MS18311!

Please check out Alpha Template and Research section on Global Consultant Community for Staying Ahead

Good.
Well understood.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVICE.
THESE TIPS ARE VERY HELPFUL.

thank you for this tips.
thats really good.

To enhance Alpha returns, focus on higher turnover, lower decay values, and smaller, more liquid universes.
Balancing returns and drawdowns while increasing volatility can also boost performance.
Leverage news and analyst datasets for innovative Alpha ideas, as they often provide actionable insights with strong return potential.
Experiment and optimize strategically.

Great insights on enhancing alpha performance!
Increasing turnover and optimizing decay values can indeed maximize returns.
Incorporating news and analyst datasets is a smart movetimely data drives better predictions.
Balancing liquidity and volatility is also key.
Thanks

In Base payment, individual consultants in IQC compete with each other to accrue between 1 to 60 for the first 4 alphas that they submit in a day EST timezone.

You can take the below steps to increase your Base payment.

Understand the components that make up the Base payment.
And how can you score the maximum in each component.

Submit Alphas with good performance in the in-sample period.
Low correlation to your other Alphas.
High Sharpe.
High fitness.

Diversify your Alphas, use larger universes in the simulation settings

Universes  especially the larger ones e.g., Top 3000.

Low correlation to your other Alphas

High Sharpe

High Fitness

Alpha rating Spectacular Excellent does not imply high quality factor or high base payment

Keep improving over time and continue innovating.
The more you improve from day to day, the higher payout you can receive.

Check out the Learn section and test different ideas underpinning the creation of your Alphas.
Submit more Alphas that are better today than you did before.

Since you are compared against other consultants, enter all of your best submissions up to the daily limit every day

Your productivity is relative and compared to all other consultants, hence you are more likely to earn more on days when other consultants submit fewer Alphas, lower quality Alphas, or highly correlated Alphas, etc.

NOTE Till June 30, all IQC consultants will have the same value factor

Submit Alphas that retain at least 70 of their Sharpe in the sub-universe or super-universe

Keep turnover 30 and margin  4 bps

Dont insert expressions noise in your Alphas just to pass the correlation test.

The WorldQuant Challenge is a perpetual, online, solo competition.
Users can submit Alphas to improve their scores and ranking.

Individuals who score 10,000 points may be eligible to receive an invitation for the research consultant opportunity, subject to other criteria e.g.
if they are residents in countries where the BRAIN consultant program is offered.
Users who make it to Gold and Silver levels will have access to special training sessions and videos through the Events page.

New users are automatically enrolled into the challenge.
The Leaderboard ranks all eligible users and can be filtered by country, university andor city.

Each day, all Alphas submitted by a user accumulated and two factors are calculated

Quantity Factor Larger the number of Alphas you submit during a day.
Larger the factor, higher your score

Quality factor Quality factor is calculated as an average of the quality factor of all Alphas submitted during the day.
Larger the factor, higher your score.
It depends on the following settings and results in the in-sample period

Both factors are then normalized across all the users who submitted at least one Alpha on that particular day.
Your final daily score is then function of normalized Quantity and Quality Factors.
The daily score is capped at 2,000 points.

Mistakenly I had submitted 3 alphas yesterday and my points today went up by 2000 which is according to the guidelines.
However I am sure this is only after taking 1 alpha into consideration.My doubt is, will the score for my other 2 alphas be realized today and tomorrow, or will they go into waste?

I think the best strategy is just submit 1 per day

According to the program, each day, I can only earn a maximum of 2000 points, which is equal to 1 alpha, but today I submitted 5 alphas, so I can only earn a maximum of 2000 points.
So in the following days, can I accumulate points because at one time I submitted too many alphas?

Can anyone help me figure out why the two values arent matching?
Ive already cleared the cache and tried switching browsers.
Thank you!

An Alpha is defined by WorldQuant as a mathematical model that seeks to predict the future price movements of various financial instruments.
See articles on the Alphas page.

Alpha list is a tool to compare your Alphas and check the correlation of those Alphas with each other.
You can add your Alphas to a list using Alpha to list and Alpha lists tools available on the Alphas page and Simulate page in the right upper corner.
The same tool allows comparing PnL graphs of Alphas of the same list.

An Alpha created on a single dataset with relaxed submission checks.

httpssupport.worldquantbrain.comhcen-uscommunityposts26969724290327-Opportunity-Webinar-Oct-2024-ATOM-7-Oct-2024

Replace missing values in the underlying data.
See DocumentationOperators to read about kth_element and group_backfill operators.

Backtesting refers to the process of testing a model or Alpha on historical data.
See IS-OS page to read about In-Sample and Out-of-Sample simulation.

We use the background check to verify that a person is who heshe claims to be and to comply with various applicable laws and regulations across countries related to the engagement of consultants.
See Why is background check important?
What happens in the background check?

Base payment accrued daily or base fees, as more fully described in your consulting agreement is the amount you are eligible to earn for the Alphas andor SuperAlphas you submit each day.
See What is a periodic payment?
How is it calculated?
and FAQCompensation for more details.

Bollinger bands are composed of three lines.
One of the more common calculations of Bollinger Bands uses a 20-day SMA for the middle band.
The upper band is calculated by taking the middle band and adding the daily standard deviation to that amount.
The lower band is calculated by taking the middle band minus the daily standard deviation.

Booksize refers to the amount of capital money used to trade during the simulation.
The Booksize used on the platform is constant and is set to 20 million every day throughout the simulation.
Simulated profit is not reinvested, and simulated losses are replaced by cash injection into the portfolio.
See Simulation results page for details on Alpha simulation results.

Refers to the maximum amount of capital that can be allocated to an Alpha before its marginal profitability PnL from allocating another dollar falls below some desired level.

Daily market capitalization commonly referred to as market cap is the total market value of a companys outstanding shares of stock.
To calculate the market cap for a given company, multiply the total number of outstanding shares by the market price of a share.
Cap is a data field of Price-Volume-Dataset.

It is the expression used to combine the Alphas selected using the selection expression in a SuperAlpha.
The output of the combo expression is a set of daily weights for each of the selected Alphas.

WQBrain consultant is an independent contractor part-time flexible position that offers individuals the ability to provide services in the form of Alphas to WorldQuant from anywhere within their respective country and at their own schedule.
Consultants develop Alphas as defined above that may be used in WorldQuants strategies deployed from licensed trading locations.

Correlation measures the uniqueness of an Alpha.
Please see DocumentationAlpha Submission and FAQ for more details.

Coverage refers to the fraction of the total instruments present in the universe for which the given datafield has a defined value.
Low coverage fields can be handled by making use of backfill operators like ts_backfill, kth element, group_backfill, etc.
Make use of the visualization feature to analyze the coverage of the data fields.
Read this BRAIN Forum Post to know more about coverage handling.

A named collection of data, which has constant type and business meaning.
For example, open price is of constant type numeric, and it consistently means the price of a security at the starting time of the trading period.
Close price has the same type as open price, but its a different field as it differs in business meaning.

A source of information on one or more variables of interest for the WorldQuant investment process.
A collection of data fields.
For example price volume data for US equities or analyst target price predictions for US equities.
See Datasets.

Dataset Value Score is a measure which signifies underutilization of a dataset.
Consultants are advised to research and make Alphas using datasets with a higher value score.
Dont confuse this with Value Factor.

Sets input data equal to a linearly decreasing weighted average of that data over the last selected number of days.

An option in Alpha settings Delay1 Alphas trade in the morning using data from yesterday Delay0 Alphas trade in the evening using data from today.

A distribution of a portion of a companys earnings, decided by the board of directors, paid to a class of its shareholders.

Drawdown is the largest reduction in PnL during a given period, expressed as a percentage.
It is calculated as follows find the largest peak to trough gap in PnL, and divide its dollar amount by half of booksize or 10 million.
See Simulation results for details on Alpha simulation results.

Fast expression or BRAIN expression is a proprietary programming language used by WorldQuant BRAIN that is designed to have ease in writing and testing financial models.
It provides a clear and concise way to express complex ideas and algorithms that can be easily understood by other developers and researchers.
Read the documentation on Fast Expression to know more about its syntax and usage.

Financial ratios are created with the use of numerical values taken from financial statements to gain meaningful information about a company.
The numbers found on a companys financial statements  balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement  are used to perform quantitative analysis and assess a companys liquidity, leverage, growth, margins, profitability, rates of return, valuation, and more.
Please refer here for more details  and watch video 4 min about financial ratios.

Fitness is defined in the Alpha Performance help page Fitness  Sharpe  sqrtabsReturns  MaxTurnover,0.125.

Fundamental analysis is a method of measuring a securitys intrinsic value by examining related economic and financial factors.
Fundamental analysts study anything that can affect a securitys value, from macroeconomic factors such as the state of the economy and industry conditions to microeconomic factors like the effectiveness of the companys management.
Please refer here for more details .

A leveled system for WorldQuant BRAIN consultants that provides increasing access to data, tools, and opportunities based on performance and activity levels.
There are four levels Gold default level for new BRAIN consultants, Expert, Master, and Grandmaster.

httpssupport.worldquantbrain.comhcen-usarticles26715715449239-What-is-the-BRAIN-Genius-Program

Type of field which has information about instrument segregation into various groups.
They are supposed to be used as an input to the group operator.
Some grouping type fields are industry, subindustry and sector

An illiquid universe refers to the collection of instruments associated with low liquidity.
Such a universe is subjected to lower trading volumes and is generally associated with higher transaction costs.

An industry is a group of companies that are related based on their primary business activities.
Industry classifications are typically grouped into larger categories called sectors.
Please refer here for more details .

Information ratio IR measures the potential predictive ability of a model.
In the BRAIN platform, it is defined as the ratio of a simulated portfolios mean daily returns to the volatility of those returns.
Please watch video 7 min on simulation results and see DocumentationAlpha Performance for details.

In-sample performance of an Alpha is the performance obtained from backtesting on historical data.
This is the performance you see on the results page when simulating an Alpha.
See Documentation for Alphas page and IS, Semi OS and OS for details.

Instrument is a financial term for any tradeable security stocks, futures, currencies, bonds, ETFs, options, etc..
Please refer to FAQ and Financial Instruments wiki for more details .

Investability Constraints ensure that the positions taken by an Alpha are within the liquidity limits of the instruments.
This helps avoid significant market impact, which can negatively affect the Alphas profitability.
An Alpha that performs well under Investability Constraints will potentially have higher capacity and liquidity.

httpsplatform.worldquantbrain.comlearndocumentationadvanced-topicsgetting-started-investability-constrained-metrics

The IS Ladder test checks if Sharpe over the most recent years are consistently above respective minimum thresholds.
It is one of the statistical significance tests to reduce the possibility of false positive random signals.
Check Documentation for details.

Kurtosis is the fourth central standardized moment of time-series vector X.

BRAIN platform uses an Alpha to create a vector of weights, with each weight corresponding to one of the stocks in the selected universe.
These weights may or may not be market neutralized, as per your neutralization setting by market, industry, subindustry or none.
This creates a portfolio for each day in the simulation period, which can then be used to calculate that days Profit and Loss PnL.

A Z-score is a numerical measurement of a values relationship to the mean in a group of values.
If a Z-score is 0, it means the score is equal to the mean.

Z-Score  data - mean  StdDev of x for each instrument within its group.

A Z-Score can be calculated in BRAIN by ts_zscore and group_zscore.

Zscore is a strong tool for comparing values.

The WorldQuant Challenge is a perpetual, online, solo competition.
Users can submit Alphas to improve their scores and ranking.

Individuals who score 10,000 points may be eligible to receive an invitation for the research consultant opportunity, subject to other criteria e.g.
if they are residents in countries where the BRAIN consultant program is offered.
Users who make it to Gold and Silver levels will have access to special training sessions and videos through the Events page.

New users are automatically enrolled into the challenge.
The Leaderboard ranks all eligible users and can be filtered by country, university andor city.

Each day, all Alphas submitted by a user accumulated and two factors are calculated

Quantity Factor Larger the number of Alphas you submit during a day.
Larger the factor, higher your score

Quality factor Quality factor is calculated as an average of the quality factor of all Alphas submitted during the day.
Larger the factor, higher your score.
It depends on the following settings and results in the in-sample period

Both factors are then normalized across all the users who submitted at least one Alpha on that particular day.
Your final daily score is then function of normalized Quantity and Quality Factors.
The daily score is capped at 2,000 points.

Mistakenly I had submitted 3 alphas yesterday and my points today went up by 2000 which is according to the guidelines.
However I am sure this is only after taking 1 alpha into consideration.My doubt is, will the score for my other 2 alphas be realized today and tomorrow, or will they go into waste?

I think the best strategy is just submit 1 per day

According to the program, each day, I can only earn a maximum of 2000 points, which is equal to 1 alpha, but today I submitted 5 alphas, so I can only earn a maximum of 2000 points.
So in the following days, can I accumulate points because at one time I submitted too many alphas?

Can anyone help me figure out why the two values arent matching?
Ive already cleared the cache and tried switching browsers.
Thank you!

This Intermediate guide aims to further your understanding of the alphas you have simulated.
The documentation will provide you with an in-depth understanding of commonly used operators and get you up to speed to improve your ability to create a high-performing alpha.

Understanding Your Results

If youve followed the examples in the Starter pack, chances are youve ended up with the first 2 graphs.
What both graphs have in common is that they have multiple periods of significant losses, producing a graph with high fluctuations.
This means that your simulated portfolio could lose a large percentage of its value in one day, and that wouldnt be ideal.
Rather, a good alpha should produce a steadily rising PnL chart 3rd graph with few fluctuations and no major drawdown.

In-sample simulation uses data over a 5-year timeframe, and tests out how well your alpha performs in the historical period.
After the simulation, you will see the IS Summary row with 6 metrics Sharpe, Turnover, Fitness, Returns, Drawdown, and Margin.

Sharpe

This ratio measures the excess return or risk premium per unit of deviation of returns of an Alpha.
It takes the mean of the PnL divided by the standard deviation of the PnL.
The higher the Sharpe Ratio or Information Ratio IR, the more consistent the Alphas returns are potentially likely to be, and consistency is an ideal trait.
The passing requirement for Sharpe on the BRAIN platform is to be above 1.25 for Delay 1 alphas and above 2.0 for Delay 0 alphas.

Turnover

Turnover of an Alpha is metric that measures the simulated daily trading activity, i.e., how often the Alpha trades.
It can be defined as the ratio of value traded to book size.
The higher the turnover, the more often a trade occurs.
Since trading incurs transaction costs, reducing turnover is generally an ideal trait.
The passing requirement for turnover on the BRAIN platform is to be between 1 and 70.

Fitness

Fitness of an Alpha is a function of Returns, Turnover  Sharpe.
Fitness is defined as

Good Alphas generally have high fitness.
You can seek to improve the performance of your Alphas by increasing Sharpe or returns and reducing turnover.
The passing requirement for fitness on the BRAIN platform is to be greater than 1.0 for Delay 1 alphas and above 1.3 for Delay 0 alphas.

Returns

Returns is the amount made or lost by the Alpha during a defined period and is expressed in percentages.
BRAIN defines returns as

Drawdown

Drawdown of an Alpha is the largest reduction in simulated PnL during a given period, expressed as a percentage.
It is calculated as follows

Margin

Margin is the simulated profit per dollar traded of an Alpha calculated as

Thus, you can try to improve the Sub-Universe Sharpe by increasing the Universe of instruments i.e.
selecting Top3000.

Check your spelling of the data fields and operators and ensure that your expression is logical.
The tokens operators and keywords allowed in your Alpha expression can be found in the Available Market Data and Available Operators pages.
Alpha expressions also accept integers and floating point numbers.

Unit warnings are provided for reference in simple cases and do not prevent submission.
Usually, this warning appears when data fields having two different units are added or multiplied.
E.g.
if you add close to cap.
close has units of price but cap has units of priceshares.
You can safely ignore these warnings if youre sure the alpha correctly handles data units.

Syntax trade_whenEvent_condition, Alpha_expression, -1

The trade_when operator has several uses it is used in order to change Alpha values under a specified condition, close Alpha positions simulated under a specified condition and to hold Alpha values in other cases.
It is instrumental in reducing turnover.

The operator takes as input, the event condition and the Alpha expression.
If exit condition is true, the Alpha is equal to NaN does not trade.
If exit condition is false and event condition is true, Alpha  Alpha expression.
Finally, if exit condition is false and event condition is false, the Alpha is equal to the previous days Alpha, thus the same positions are held.

Example

ranktrade_whenvolumeadv20,-returns,-1.
Suppose we believe that stocks that give high returns today could give low returns tomorrow this concept is known as reversion.
We note that reversion is typically observed more profoundly in stocks showing high volume trading activity or high volatility in stock returns.
Thus, we should implement the Alpha expression based on only when the number of stocks traded today is higher than the monthly average by using trade_whenvolumeadv20.

Another conditional operator is the if_else operator.
The syntax is as follows if_elseEvent_condition, Alpha_expression_1, Alpha_expression_2

The first and foremost step of building an Alpha is coming up with an Alpha idea.
In the beginning, the Learn section of the platform is a good resource for sourcing ideas.
For instance, the Example tab and Alpha concepts page are very useful.
Here are some general guidelines to build Alphas

Know your Operators The second step of the research process is to implement your Alpha idea using operators.
Hence, it is important to understand the concept of operators well.
We recommend you go through the detailed operator descriptions before reading the research papers.

Formulating your alpha The final step is to formulate your Alpha.
This is where your understanding of the operators comes in.
Try to replicate the idea suggested in the paper and assess its performance, then think of any improvements that can be made on this version using any additional operators  data.

We will take you through an example to show you how you can come up with an idea and refine it to create an Alpha.

Iteration 1

In this example we are using the if_else conditional operator, ts_deltaclose,2 difference of close price today and 2 days ago, volume volume today and adv20 average daily volume in past 20 days datafields.

Our Hypothesis is If the stock price of a company has increased over the last 2 days, it may decrease in the future.
Also, if the number of stocks bought and sold today is higher than the monthly average, then the reversion effect may be observed more profoundly.

Implementation We will take positions according to the difference of close price today and 3 days ago with alpha_2 using the ts_delta operator.
When current volume is higher than average daily volume, we will take a larger position by multiplying by 2 to get alpha_1.
Simulation settings are left as default.

Here are the results

The Alpha cant be submitted but the results arent too bad either.
This is a good sign for us and increases our confidence in the idea since our first implementation has shown decent results.
Performance metrics give us a direction that we need to focus on increasing the fitness.

Iteration 2

In our first iteration, we used the if_else operator, what if we used the trade_when operator?
We can try another implementation of our idea by entering our positions when current volume is higher than average daily volume, and maintain this position for the remainder of the quarter.

Here are the results

Our turnover has decreased since we moved from if_else to trade_when operator and take positions in all the stocks.
Our fitness has increased, going from 0.71 to 0.93.
However, the fitness is still below 1 and remains un-submittable.
Lets see how else we can improve this idea.

Iteration 3

For iteration 3, we will use the same Alpha expression as Iteration 2 and adjust the simulation settings.

We will change decay to 2, neutralization to Industry and truncation to 0.01.

Here is the result

We see a significant improvement in most of our performance metrics.
Sharpe has increased from 1.75 to 1.93, fitness has improved from 0.93 to 1.07, but turnover has increased.
Thus, we see from this iteration that this mean reversion strategy works better when it is industry neutralized, decay is lowered and truncation is reduced.

Summary

You can use different implementations for the same idea on the BRAIN platform or use any of the numerous data fields at your disposal to improve an idea.
Implementing new ideas will help you build higher Sharpe Alphas.
After reading this Intermediate pack, you now have an array of operators and datafields at your disposal, lets get simulating!

Syntax trade_whenEvent_condition, Alpha_expression, -1

The trade_when operator has several uses it is used in order to change Alpha values under a specified condition, close Alpha positions simulated under a specified condition and to hold Alpha values in other cases.
It is instrumental in reducing turnover.

The operator takes as input, the event condition and the Alpha expression.
If exit condition is true, the Alpha is equal to NaN does not trade.
If exit condition is false and event condition is true, Alpha  Alpha expression.
Finally, if exit condition is false and event condition is false, the Alpha is equal to the previous days Alpha, thus the same positions are held.

Example

ranktrade_whenvolumeadv20,-returns,-1.
Suppose we believe that stocks that give high returns today could give low returns tomorrow this concept is known as reversion.
We note that reversion is typically observed more profoundly in stocks showing high volume trading activity or high volatility in stock returns.
Thus, we should implement the Alpha expression based on only when the number of stocks traded today is higher than the monthly average by using trade_whenvolumeadv20.

Another conditional operator is the if_else operator.
The syntax is as follows if_elseEvent_condition, Alpha_expression_1, Alpha_expression_2

The first and foremost step of building an Alpha is coming up with an Alpha idea.
In the beginning, the Learn section of the platform is a good resource for sourcing ideas.
For instance, the Example tab and Alpha concepts page are very useful.
Here are some general guidelines to build Alphas

Know your Operators The second step of the research process is to implement your Alpha idea using operators.
Hence, it is important to understand the concept of operators well.
We recommend you go through the detailed operator descriptions before reading the research papers.

Formulating your alpha The final step is to formulate your Alpha.
This is where your understanding of the operators comes in.
Try to replicate the idea suggested in the paper and assess its performance, then think of any improvements that can be made on this version using any additional operators  data.

We will take you through an example to show you how you can come up with an idea and refine it to create an Alpha.

Iteration 1

In this example we are using the if_else conditional operator, ts_deltaclose,2 difference of close price today and 2 days ago, volume volume today and adv20 average daily volume in past 20 days datafields.

Our Hypothesis is If the stock price of a company has increased over the last 2 days, it may decrease in the future.
Also, if the number of stocks bought and sold today is higher than the monthly average, then the reversion effect may be observed more profoundly.

Implementation We will take positions according to the difference of close price today and 3 days ago with alpha_2 using the ts_delta operator.
When current volume is higher than average daily volume, we will take a larger position by multiplying by 2 to get alpha_1.
Simulation settings are left as default.

Here are the results

The Alpha cant be submitted but the results arent too bad either.
This is a good sign for us and increases our confidence in the idea since our first implementation has shown decent results.
Performance metrics give us a direction that we need to focus on increasing the fitness.

Iteration 2

In our first iteration, we used the if_else operator, what if we used the trade_when operator?
We can try another implementation of our idea by entering our positions when current volume is higher than average daily volume, and maintain this position for the remainder of the quarter.

Here are the results

Our turnover has decreased since we moved from if_else to trade_when operator and take positions in all the stocks.
Our fitness has increased, going from 0.71 to 0.93.
However, the fitness is still below 1 and remains un-submittable.
Lets see how else we can improve this idea.

First off, you can use different operators.
Remember the cross-sectional operators and time-series operators from the Starterpack?
You can use them here.
Secondly, you can try out different data fields.
We recommend exploring the price volume dataset, model dataset and fundamental dataset.
Lastly, you can tinker with different simulation settings.
These tips should help improve the performance of your second Alpha.

Divide

We can divide datafields with other datafields.

Imagine market data being a matrix, with each row representing one date and each column representing one stock.
For example, the matrix for close price data of stocks in universe US TOP3000 would look like this

And the matrix for open data of above stocks would look like this

Say you enter an Alpha expression like closeopen in the Simulate page found in the Alphas dropdown tab.
When you click Simulate, the BRAIN platform will evaluate the Alpha expression against the matrix of market data for each date and each stock.

Rankx

Description the Rank operator ranks the value of the input data x for the given stock among all instruments, and returns float numbers equally distributed between 0.0 and 1.0

Alpha expression ranksalesassets.
If company B has a higher asset turnover ratio salesassets than company A, stock B may outperform stock A.
The rank operator helps to limit the extreme values of that ratio.
For example

The numbers imply that if you have 126, you must use 100 to go long stock E 80 of your total capital.
So, your strategy would depend crucially on how the last stock performs.
But, isnt that too risky?
Applying the rank function to the alpha expression ranksalesassets, you get

This time you see that the stock with the largest weight occupies only 40 of your portfolio.

Ts_rank  Ts_delta Operator

Visual Illustration of Ts_rank Operator

In your first Alpha simulation, you left the simulation settings on default.
Changing certain simulation settings may help you improve your Alpha results.
We will go through Region, Universe, Neutralization, Decay and Truncation.
The other settings will be covered in a later guide.

Region

Region refers to the market in which the Alpha will simulate trades, for example, the U.S.
equity market or Chinese equity market.

Universe

Universe is a set of trading instruments ranked by their liquidity.
For example, US TOP3000 represents the top 3,000 most liquid stocks in the U.S.
market.

Decay

Decay is used for averaging the Alpha signal within a specified time window.
The settings perform linear decay on the Alpha.
Tip Decay can be used to reduce turnover, but decay values that are too large will attenuate the signal.

Truncation sets the maximum weight for each stock in the overall portfolio.
It aims to guard against excessive exposure to movements in individual stocks.
The recommended setting is between 0.05 and 0.1 entailing 5-10.

Neutralization

Market risks and industry specific risks are prevalent risks within equities.
However, these risks can be reduced by creating long-short neutral portfolios using a concept called neutralization.
After neutralizing the portfolios to market or industry specific groups, no net position is taken with respect to that group, i.e.
allotting the same amount of dollars in long buying and short selling positions.
That way, you are less exposed to risk, whether the entire market goes up or down.

When Neutralization  MarketIndustrySub-industry it does the following operation Alpha  Alpha  meanAlpha where Alpha is the vector of weights.

If the hypothetical booksize is 20 million, we would end up investing 10 million in long positions and 10 million in short positions.
Thus, no net position is taken with respect to the market.
In other words, the long exposure cancels out the short exposure completely, making this hypothetical strategy market neutral.

The three different neutralization methods determine which groups are used for neutralizing Alpha values.
The correct choice of neutralization depends on the logic or formula used by the Alpha.
The results should indicate which neutralization will be most effective.

Error message

Likely cause  resolution

Attempted to use unknown variable

An unavailable variable was included within the expression.
Check if your variable has a typo or if you are using the right region in the settings.
Tip Font color of data fields and operators show up as blue text, if used correctly in the expression.

Unexpected end of input

A common syntax error usually comes from missing parentheses or missing semi-colon.
Example ranksalesassets would raise this error

Expression cannot be empty

This error is often raised when users assign their alpha to a variable without actually calling it afterwards.Example alpha  -ts_deltaclose,5 would raise the error but alpha  -ts_deltaclose,5 alpha would not.

Illegal group index value, cannot exceed number of elements

To ensure high performance of platform, a check is made on group indices values during simulation.
Index values should not exceed amount of elements belonging to all indexed groups.
If an error message is raised, it is likely that groups index used in one of operators is not dense not dense index looks like 0, 5, 8, 26, 107.
In this case, using densifygroup instead of group will help.

Illegal group index value, cannot be negative

We dont allow negative values for group index, to resolve this problem, try using densify operator.

Got invalid value for attribute lookback, must be constant or string

This error is raised when you try to use a non-constant or string for lookback field of an operator.
Or when you place your parameters in the wrong order.Example ts_ranksalesassets, days_from_last_changesales would raise the error

Grouping data used outside of group operator

Grouping data are meant to be used in group operator only.
This error is raised if you try to use the group data somewhere else.Example ts_deltaindustry, 5 would raise the error

Cumulative lookback of expression exceeds available history

Due to limited data history, if you try to lookback further than we can provide, this error is raised.
Notice that the cumulative lookback is considered the highest lookback used in the expression.Example ts_rankts_meanclose,20,20 would have the cumulative lookback of 40.

You have reached the limit of concurrent simulations.
Please wait for previous simulations to finish

You can only simulate a limited amount of alphas at once so if you try to simulate more than that, this error will be raised.
You have to wait until one of your previous simulations to finish to continue.

Invalid number of inputs X, should be exactly Y inputs

This error is raised when you provide more or less number of inputs than required.Example Both group_meansalesassets, market and group_meansalesassets, 1, market, 1 would raise this error.
The correct expression would be group_meansalesassets, 1, market

At least 10 component alphas are required for SuperAlpha Competition

Try to increase the number of selected Alphas - change the selection expression to ensure at least 10 Alphas are used in your SuperAlpha.

The error happens when there are too many or large operators or datasets, even if the expression seems simple.
To fix this, make your Alpha simpler or use fewer operators or datasets.

An Alpha is defined by WorldQuant as a mathematical model that seeks to predict the future price movements of various financial instruments.
See articles on the Alphas page.

Alpha list is a tool to compare your Alphas and check the correlation of those Alphas with each other.
You can add your Alphas to a list using Alpha to list and Alpha lists tools available on the Alphas page and Simulate page in the right upper corner.
The same tool allows comparing PnL graphs of Alphas of the same list.

An Alpha created on a single dataset with relaxed submission checks.

httpssupport.worldquantbrain.comhcen-uscommunityposts26969724290327-Opportunity-Webinar-Oct-2024-ATOM-7-Oct-2024

Replace missing values in the underlying data.
See DocumentationOperators to read about kth_element and group_backfill operators.

Backtesting refers to the process of testing a model or Alpha on historical data.
See IS-OS page to read about In-Sample and Out-of-Sample simulation.

We use the background check to verify that a person is who heshe claims to be and to comply with various applicable laws and regulations across countries related to the engagement of consultants.
See Why is background check important?
What happens in the background check?

Base payment accrued daily or base fees, as more fully described in your consulting agreement is the amount you are eligible to earn for the Alphas andor SuperAlphas you submit each day.
See What is a periodic payment?
How is it calculated?
and FAQCompensation for more details.

Bollinger bands are composed of three lines.
One of the more common calculations of Bollinger Bands uses a 20-day SMA for the middle band.
The upper band is calculated by taking the middle band and adding the daily standard deviation to that amount.
The lower band is calculated by taking the middle band minus the daily standard deviation.

Booksize refers to the amount of capital money used to trade during the simulation.
The Booksize used on the platform is constant and is set to 20 million every day throughout the simulation.
Simulated profit is not reinvested, and simulated losses are replaced by cash injection into the portfolio.
See Simulation results page for details on Alpha simulation results.

Refers to the maximum amount of capital that can be allocated to an Alpha before its marginal profitability PnL from allocating another dollar falls below some desired level.

Daily market capitalization commonly referred to as market cap is the total market value of a companys outstanding shares of stock.
To calculate the market cap for a given company, multiply the total number of outstanding shares by the market price of a share.
Cap is a data field of Price-Volume-Dataset.

It is the expression used to combine the Alphas selected using the selection expression in a SuperAlpha.
The output of the combo expression is a set of daily weights for each of the selected Alphas.

WQBrain consultant is an independent contractor part-time flexible position that offers individuals the ability to provide services in the form of Alphas to WorldQuant from anywhere within their respective country and at their own schedule.
Consultants develop Alphas as defined above that may be used in WorldQuants strategies deployed from licensed trading locations.

Correlation measures the uniqueness of an Alpha.
Please see DocumentationAlpha Submission and FAQ for more details.

Coverage refers to the fraction of the total instruments present in the universe for which the given datafield has a defined value.
Low coverage fields can be handled by making use of backfill operators like ts_backfill, kth element, group_backfill, etc.
Make use of the visualization feature to analyze the coverage of the data fields.
Read this BRAIN Forum Post to know more about coverage handling.

A named collection of data, which has constant type and business meaning.
For example, open price is of constant type numeric, and it consistently means the price of a security at the starting time of the trading period.
Close price has the same type as open price, but its a different field as it differs in business meaning.

A source of information on one or more variables of interest for the WorldQuant investment process.
A collection of data fields.
For example price volume data for US equities or analyst target price predictions for US equities.
See Datasets.

Dataset Value Score is a measure which signifies underutilization of a dataset.
Consultants are advised to research and make Alphas using datasets with a higher value score.
Dont confuse this with Value Factor.

Sets input data equal to a linearly decreasing weighted average of that data over the last selected number of days.

An option in Alpha settings Delay1 Alphas trade in the morning using data from yesterday Delay0 Alphas trade in the evening using data from today.

thank you

Hopefully Brain will consider expanding the 1 month D0 alpha submission limit.
Currently 30 D0 alphas is quite low, hopefully this number will be pushed higher 60 - 90.
Thanks.

Your insights into creating effective D0 alphas are incredibly valuable!
The breakdown of strategies, from leveraging D0-specific data like price-volume and open price to exploring event-driven and sentiment-based approaches, offers a clear roadmap for beginners and experienced participants alike.
Thank you!

thank you for this.

Delay 0 D0 alphas utilize same-day data for faster trading.
Start with D1 concepts adapted to D0 data like price-volume or sentiment.
Explore news-based triggers, group reversion, and technical indicators applied to sentiment or fundamental data.
Focus on liquid universes and low-turnover datasets for effective D0 strategies with unique behavior.

D0 alphas trade using data from the same day, often providing more immediate market reactions compared to D1 alphas, which use data from the previous day.
To create effective D0 alphas, you can start with D1 alpha ideas, but adapt them to use more timely data like price, volume, and news.
For instance, using open prices and calculating group reversion can help predict stock movements based on collective trends.
Additionally, news and sentiment data can act as event triggers for strategies, while reversion concepts can be tested using sentiment indicators like RSI.
D0 alphas often excel in liquid universes and work well with low-turnover datasets, such as fundamentals and analyst data, as well as group or relationship datasets.

Very insightful, will definitely give DO alphas a try

how to get alphas to submit?because i have tried but Im not getting

Delay is an option in the alpha settings that determines when your strategy takes positions in stocks.
Delay1 alphas trade in the morning using data from yesterday delay0 alphas trade in the afternoon using data from today.

Here are some tips to begin creating D0 alphas

thank you

Hopefully Brain will consider expanding the 1 month D0 alpha submission limit.
Currently 30 D0 alphas is quite low, hopefully this number will be pushed higher 60 - 90.
Thanks.

Your insights into creating effective D0 alphas are incredibly valuable!
The breakdown of strategies, from leveraging D0-specific data like price-volume and open price to exploring event-driven and sentiment-based approaches, offers a clear roadmap for beginners and experienced participants alike.
Thank you!

thank you for this.

Sub-universe test is one of the robustness tests performed on an Alpha by the BRAIN before submission.
In simple words, it ensures that your Alpha works not only in the universe youre trying to submit, but that it could also work in the next more liquid or smaller universe to some extent.

E.
g.
If youre trying to submit an Alpha on USA TOP3000, the platform will also check its performance on USA TOP1000.
If it performs poorly, then it means that your Alpha is generating most of the profit on the non-liquid portion of stocks, which is one of the signs that your Alpha is not robust enough and most likely will not perform as well as expected in out-of-sample testing.
Thats why such Alphas are not allowed to be submitted on Brain.

Technical details

Consider an Alpha in USA TOP3000 which fails sub-universe test

Notice cutoff

Lets check this Alpha performance on next more liquid universe, TOP1000

As you see, Sharpe ratio degraded significantly to 1.17, less than the cutoff of 1.18.

Ive recently found it can sometimes be solved simply by increasing the truncation value to allow for efficient allocation of weights in the sub universe whereby you can possibly improve the Sharpe ratio.

Unit warnings are provided for reference in simple cases and do not prevent submission.
You can safely ignore these warnings if youre sure alpha correctly handles data units.

This warning message appears when you try to perform arithmetic operations on fields having different units, for example alpha close  adv20 raises this warning, because you are trying to add close measured in dollars and adv20 measured in number of shares.
It is like adding apples and oranges and expecting the sum to be apples.

But keep in mind that unit warnings are provided for reference in simple cases and do not prevent submission.
You can safely ignore these warnings if youre sure alpha correctly handles data units.

Also if you really want this warning to go away, you can try ranking the fields involved, for example instead of close  adv20 try rankclose  rankadv20 which raises no warning because it adds together compatible ranks instead of incompatible dollars and shares.

We expect our consultants to create unique signals, and self-correlation test is a way to ensure that an alpha you are trying to submit is different from the ones you have submitted in the past.
Your new alpha is highly correlated to your past alpha and is also not better in performance, thus it fails the self-correlation check.
The best way to resolve this error is to work on different datasets, use a different operator set and work on diverse ideas.

what if i receive this error even when there are no alphas reflected as submitted on my account?
i actually submitted many alphas but all got this error.
yet on my account portfolio page it shows that i have 0 alphas submitted.

Hi,

This error will not pop up if you have 0 alphas submitted.
In case you are not able to see the submitted alphas on your alphas page, please raise this issue as a ticket.

My alphas also failed the self-correlation test even though I havent submitted any alphas.
My OS section also shows 0 submissions.

NP20494I saw you have submitted quite many alphas, could you check again?

I literally get the self-correlation message on every new alpha - nevermind that I am using completely different operators and datasets.
Id post my alphas here but I dont want them to be taken for the purposes of the competition - I can dm them.
As things are, I am literally unable to progress in the competition as ANYTHING I try to submit is self-correlated despite never using any of that code before...

FV95768 I think you are keeping neutralization setting as none.

We expect our consultants to create unique signals, and self-correlation test is a way to ensure that an alpha you are trying to submit is different from the ones you have submitted in the past.
Your new alpha is highly correlated to your past alpha and is also not better in performance, thus it fails the self-correlation check.
The best way to resolve this error is to work on different datasets, use a different operator set and work on diverse ideas.

what if i receive this error even when there are no alphas reflected as submitted on my account?
i actually submitted many alphas but all got this error.
yet on my account portfolio page it shows that i have 0 alphas submitted.

Hi,

This error will not pop up if you have 0 alphas submitted.
In case you are not able to see the submitted alphas on your alphas page, please raise this issue as a ticket.

My alphas also failed the self-correlation test even though I havent submitted any alphas.
My OS section also shows 0 submissions.

NP20494I saw you have submitted quite many alphas, could you check again?

I literally get the self-correlation message on every new alpha - nevermind that I am using completely different operators and datasets.
Id post my alphas here but I dont want them to be taken for the purposes of the competition - I can dm them.
As things are, I am literally unable to progress in the competition as ANYTHING I try to submit is self-correlated despite never using any of that code before...

FV95768 I think you are keeping neutralization setting as none.
Please check the settings

Sub-universe test is one of the robustness tests performed on an Alpha by the BRAIN before submission.
In simple words, it ensures that your Alpha works not only in the universe youre trying to submit, but that it could also work in the next more liquid or smaller universe to some extent.

E.
g.
If youre trying to submit an Alpha on USA TOP3000, the platform will also check its performance on USA TOP1000.
If it performs poorly, then it means that your Alpha is generating most of the profit on the non-liquid portion of stocks, which is one of the signs that your Alpha is not robust enough and most likely will not perform as well as expected in out-of-sample testing.
Thats why such Alphas are not allowed to be submitted on Brain.

Technical details

Consider an Alpha in USA TOP3000 which fails sub-universe test

Lets check this Alpha performance on next more liquid universe, TOP1000

As you see, Sharpe ratio degraded significantly to 1.17, less than the cutoff of 1.18.

Ive recently found it can sometimes be solved simply by increasing the truncation value to allow for efficient allocation of weights in the sub universe whereby you can possibly improve the Sharpe ratio.
